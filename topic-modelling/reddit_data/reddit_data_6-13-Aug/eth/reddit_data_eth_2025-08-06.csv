"$6,000/month running a small online store","Hello, I would like to share with you how my life changed thanks to a random post on Reddit. In short, I had a job that I did not enjoy, I had to wake up early, my boss was very strict, but I could not quit because I needed to support my family. However, one day I came across a post u/ReasonableOutside488 where he talked about how he makes good money online. At first, I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a try, and it really worked. Right now, I make about $300 a day and spend more time with my 5-year-old daughter and wife. I am really grateful u/ReasonableOutside488 for helping me in a difficult time. By the way, his post is still relevant. Maybe it will also change someone else's life for the better.",False,11.0,
The Art of the Crypto Play - What's Your Strategy?,"Everyone approaches crypto with their own unique mindset. Some dive into daily trading, watching charts and making quick moves to capitalise on market swings. Others take a long-term approach, holding their assets for years with strong belief in the future of blockchain technology. Then there are those who combine both strategies or explore entirely different paths like staking, farming, or NFTs.

So what about you? What’s your personal strategy when it comes to trading or investing in crypto? Are you in it for short-term gains or long-term growth and what inspired you to take that route?

My Opinion about ETH future value.,"We all know that in the recent days we had Correction on the ETH and all the market, Some News Affected the market more than before So we had a Correction. But Even we had a Correction and So many people Scared And So many people thought that it was a Downtrend Even thought So many Big companies increased their ETH Reserve. Why?  
Is There something that they are doing this ? Why ETH ? Why not BTC?  
If you watch the list of Big holders of ETH, so may see so many Companies like Bitmine tech that they are a miner company of BTC, They have Three billion Dollar ETH Reserver.  
I think There is something that we don't know. I think We have a Correction, yes! Yes We may have Deeper Correction but in long term ETH has a Great Future and these companies know that.  
I think If BTC is Future Gold and ETH is Future Finance Market. We have a Big TVL on ETH blockchain, and. It will be more and more Every day.

I can also use cash and money order but realistically the only thing an exchange would take is a CC.

It also has to be on an exchange that gives me a seed phrase so I can ""recover"" it on a safer wallet and send it to a second wallet on the safer wallet system. I'm open to suggestions for a good safe wallet for Windows, though I think I know one already.

ETH Breakout: Is Altseason Officially Here?,"Looking at the recent performance of Ethereum (ETH), it's hard to ignore the significant upward trend! ETH is at $3,840.92 at the time of writing,  a remarkable 18.8% increase over the last year (1Y). More importantly, the current price is a strong breakout from what looked like a period of consolidation and even a dip around March-May.

This kind of strong upward movement in Ethereum is often a key indicator for the broader altcoin market. Historically, ETH has acted as a bellwether for ""Altseason"" – a period where many alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) experience substantial gains, often outperforming Bitcoin and even Ethereum itself.

**Why is ETH's breakout relevant to Altseason?**
 **Increased Confidence:** A strong ETH signals renewed investor confidence in the smart contract platform that underpins a vast majority of altcoins, including DeFi, NFTs, and various dApps.
 **Capital Rotation:** As ETH gains momentum, profits from ETH holdings often rotate into smaller-cap altcoins, fueling their price appreciation.
 **Ecosystem Health:** ETH's strength reflects the overall health and adoption of its ecosystem, which directly benefits projects built on Ethereum.

While past performance is not indicative of future results, this strong ETH breakout definitely has the crypto community buzzing about a potential Altseason. Keep an eye on your favorite altcoins – the tide might be turning!

Ten Years of Improving Ethereum: Key EIPs,"Here are the key Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that have significantly impacted Ethereum's development over its first decade:

* **EIP-20: Token Standard** (Adopted in 2017) : This EIP created the universal ERC-20 token standard, which streamlined token integration and catalyzed the ICO craze.
* **EIP-1559: Fee Markets** (Adopted in August 2021) : This proposal reformed Ethereum's fee market by introducing a dynamic ""base"" gas fee that is burned and an optional ""tip"" for validators, aiming to incentivize deflation and improve user experience.
* **EIP-3675: Proof-of-Stake** (also known as ""The Merge"") : This EIP replaced Ethereum's proof-of-work (PoW) with proof-of-stake (PoS), drastically reducing energy consumption and transforming ETH into a productive asset.
* **EIP-4844: L2 Blobs** (Implemented in March 2024) : This EIP introduced temporary storage space (""blobs"") for Layer 2 (L2) transaction data, significantly lowering L2 transaction costs and migrating much of Ethereum's activity to L2s.
* **EIP-3074: Wallet UX** (Merged in May 2025) : This proposal overhauled wallet functionality by giving externally owned accounts (EOAs) smart contract-like capabilities, enabling features like one-click approvals and gasless transactions to simplify the onchain experience.

These EIPs collectively shaped Ethereum into a constantly transforming ""living, breathing machine"" dedicated to providing decentralized compute.

Singapore-based exchange Bitrue has officially listed $HEGE on its new Bitrue Alpha platform this week. This milestone comes amid a broader resurgence in animal‑based memecoins. Over the past seven days, the global market cap of animal-themed memecoins has risen by 8.95%, while trading volume across the sector has surged by 101%, underscoring renewed interest and participation worldwide.

Within that same period, $HEGE itself has climbed 11.6%, reflecting growing attention and engagement from its community.

This milestone arrives as interest in long‑term community‑driven memecoins continues to rise. $HEGE, a hedgehog‑themed token on the Solana blockchain, has steadily evolved beyond a typical meme asset into what its community calls a brandcoin, blending on‑chain culture with off‑chain brand development.

* **Community Campaigns** – Weekly raids, meme contests, and social challenges
* **Consistent Branding** – A narrative universe positioning HEGE as more than just a memeA Market Ready for Growth

i used changenow a few months back to swap around $550K worth of crypto. things looked smooth at first, but right after the transaction, they asked me for full KYC, ID, source of funds, the whole deal. i gave them everything they asked for. this was back in march.

now it’s been 4 months. still no update. no refund. no answers. just complete silence.

i did some digging after things started feeling off and realized changenow is linked to changelly, and apparently they’ve had a bunch of people saying the same thing happened to them. then there’s atomic wallet (same devs, i think?) that got hacked for $100M last year some ppl even think it was an inside job. Guarda also keeps promoting changenow as a trusted partner, even with all these red flags.

what really stings is that i tried everything reached out politely, followed their public instructions, even DMed them after they told me to. but no one got back. some of my posts got deleted too. i kept hoping for a fair outcome... but nothing.

i’m not here to attack anyone, i’m just genuinely stuck and hurting. that was life-changing money. and it’s just... gone.

Heads up community, i wouldn’t wish this on anyone.

Idea! How to solve ETH gas problem,"Many people complain about the ETH gas fees and that it is holding ETH down. 

The issue is that the low transactions pay the same fee as the big transactions. In terms of percentage its a big % for the small transaction and a tiny % for the big transaction. 

Based on the data ETH has, why dont they find out how often the small and the big transactions occur see what they can do to solve this problem? 

For example they can decrease the gas fees on the small transactions and increase it on the big transactions. In the short term they will lose money when the small transactions occur, but when the big transactions occur they will recover the losses. 

They should work around with the data and fine the Equilibrium where they dont lose money long term and make all the customers happy.

Sold ETH at 3000!,"*Used AI to reframe my post*

I recently made a move in crypto and wanted to share my experience and get some thoughts. Around 4–5 months ago, I bought my first Ethereum coin (1 ETH) at $2,560. At the time, I was just getting into investing—this year is actually my first year seriously exploring the stock market and crypto. I’m relatively young and generally believe in long-term investing, so I wasn’t planning on selling anytime soon.

That said, my ETH purchase was kind of impulsive. I saw the price drop and jumped in without too much analysis. When it fell further to around $1,500, I was obviously disappointed, but I wasn’t panicking—I had used extra money that I didn’t urgently need, so I was mentally prepared to hold for the long term, even 5+ years if necessary.

However, when the price climbed back up and hit $3,000 recently, I decided to sell 75% of my position. My thinking was that I could potentially re-enter if the price dips again in the future. It wasn’t a panic sell—more of a calculated exit—but now I’m wondering if it was the right call.

Would love to hear your opinions. Also, sorry if this post seems a bit noob-ish—just trying to learn as I go!

Ethereum Benefits in Future Update of ZOND, QRL's First Quantum Currency.

1. **Quantum-Resistant Security** ZOND QRL is designed with post-quantum cryptography at its core. This provides a high level of protection against future quantum computing threats. As Ethereum continues to grow in value and importance, collaboration or integration with quantum-resistant technologies like ZOND could help safeguard user assets in the long term.
2. **Cross-Chain Interoperability** The ZOND update improves communication capabilities with other blockchain networks, including Ethereum. This creates opportunities for secure cross-chain bridges and decentralized applications that can interact safely between both ecosystems.
3. **Advanced Smart Contract Capabilities** ZOND introduces a new layer of smart contract functionality that can serve as a secure environment for quantum-safe applications. Ethereum developers interested in post-quantum security may benefit from using or building on ZOND as an added layer of protection.
4. **Decentralization and Governance Synergy** Both Ethereum and QRL value decentralized governance. The ZOND update strengthens community-driven decision-making, providing a governance model that can inspire or collaborate with Ethereum-based DAOs.
5. **Developer Collaboration and Innovation** The upgrade creates new opportunities for developers from both communities to work together on building quantum-secure solutions, interoperability tools, and hybrid dApps that leverage the strengths of both blockchains.
6. **Future-Proofing the Ecosystem** By adopting quantum-resistant infrastructure now, ZOND QRL helps raise awareness in the broader crypto space—including Ethereum—about the importance of preparing for quantum threats. This benefits the entire blockchain community by encouraging proactive security development.
7. **With the launch of ZOND, the QRL quantumcurrency will be listed on major Tier 1 exchanges.**

# QRL Zond – The Upgrade Ethereum Needs for the Post-Quantum Era

The Ethereum community has always led the charge in blockchain innovation: smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs – all born from a bold and visionary ecosystem. But a new era is approaching – the **era of quantum computing**, which poses a real threat to the cryptographic foundations that blockchains like Ethereum rely on.

Enter **QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger)** with its groundbreaking **Zond upgrade** – the world’s first **post-quantum, EVM-compatible chain**. This is where Ethereum’s community should pay close attention — not to see QRL as a competitor, but as a **critical ally**.

# What Does Zond Change?

1. **Quantum Resistance Built In** Zond uses quantum-resistant cryptography (XMSS), protecting against quantum threats *today* — not in theory, but in practice. Ethereum, as powerful as it is, still relies on ECDSA – an algorithm that *will* be vulnerable to quantum attacks.
2. **Full EVM Compatibility** Zond allows smart contracts written for Ethereum to run seamlessly. Developers from the Ethereum ecosystem can build on Zond using the same tools they already know — but now with post-quantum security.
3. **Future-Proof Infrastructure** QRL isn’t just preparing for the future — it’s **building** it. With Zond, any Ethereum project can instantly gain quantum resistance without sacrificing flexibility or familiarity.

# Why Ethereum and QRL Should Move Forward Together

Ethereum is the most dominant force in Web3. But with dominance comes the responsibility to **secure the foundation**. This is where QRL steps in — as a shield, a bridge, and a partner.

By investing in QRL, the Ethereum community is not just diversifying — it's **future-proofing**. It's supporting innovation that *enhances* Ethereum’s reach and resilience.

# What Can You Do Today?

* **Deploy** a smart contract on Zond — porting from Ethereum takes minutes.
* **Consider** allocating part of your ETH portfolio into QRL — as a strategic hedge.
* **Learn** more about quantum-resistant cryptography — because the future is approaching fast.

**QRL Zond isn’t an alternative to Ethereum — it’s an enhancement.**  
It’s the quantum-resistant infrastructure Ethereum doesn’t yet have — but absolutely will need.",False,5.0,
"The First created quantumcurrency appreciated by the largest defense corporation in the world - Lockheed Martin, will cooperate with Ethereum","This is a compelling development that Ethereum folks shouldn’t overlook.

QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger) was built from the ground up with quantum resistance in mind - unlike most other chains, which are now trying to retrofit that protection. With the Zond upgrade, QRL becomes the first EVM-compatible, post-quantum secure blockchain, meaning Ethereum developers can port smart contracts over with little to no friction while gaining quantum resistance from day one.

The timing is important. NIST has already selected post-quantum algorithms for standardization, and nation-state interest in quantum computing (like China's) is not slowing down. Projects like QRL have been preparing for this moment for years.

Seeking Advice: Securely Withdrawing ETH from an Old Smart Contract (Avoiding Front-Running),"Back in 2019, my brother created a learning project and sent me 2 ETH, locking it in a simple Solidity smart contract as a kind of ""puzzle vault.""

The purpose was educational. The contract uses a passphrase mechanism and a unlock condition:

**Unlocking Conditions:**

To successfully withdraw the ETH, the caller must:

1. Know the original passphrase (which I do), and
2. Send at least twice the contract's current ETH balance in the same transaction.

Here’s the contract for reference:

    pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
    
    contract HiddenVault {
        bytes32 private hashedSecret;
    
        constructor(bytes32 _hashedSecret) public payable {
            hashedSecret = _hashedSecret;
        }
    
        function unlock(bytes memory passphrase) public payable {
            uint256 vaultBalance = address(this).balance - msg.value;
            require(msg.value >= vaultBalance * 2, ""Insufficient collateral"");
            require(sha256(passphrase) == hashedSecret, ""Wrong passphrase"");
            selfdestruct(msg.sender);
        }
    }

**My Concern:**

The current balance is 2 ETH, so to meet the contract’s conditions I would need to send 4 ETH in the same transaction. If successful, the contract would self-destruct and transfer the total (6 ETH) to the caller (me), per its logic.

**Questions:**

1. Is Flashbots Protect RPC the best approach to prevent this kind of front-running?
3. How risk is do execute this contract? Can I be 100% sure I wont lose any eth?
3. Has anyone handled similar unlock patterns recently? I’d appreciate any advice on gas settings, transaction bundles, or examples.",False,2.0,

Tom Lee’s Investment Thesis,"Lee’s thesis is that large banks like JPM and BofA will issue stablecoins and buy ETH to stake. Doesn’t this diminish the point of decentralization? Isn’t that the primary benefit that Ethereum has clung too over the years?

He said nothing about increased fee revenue, likely because L2s efficiency gains will offset the increased volume. Ethereum’s network usage (mainnet) has declined in 2025, leading to lower transaction volumes and gas fees. For example, in March 2025, the daily burn volume hit an all-time low of 53.07 ETH.

Can someone explain to me what will drive value if increased usage, primarily on L2s, won’t drive significant fee revenue? 

Banks accumulating and staking ETH would impact supply and demand dynamics but at the cost of decentralization. Additionally banks staking large amounts of ETH to secure the network for their stablecoins would reduce the yield for staking ETH. Is Lee’s thesis sound?

I’m not questioning ETH’s value as a technology, I think it will be widely adopted. But, I don’t see its adoption significantly driving price appreciation.

"[ discussion ] Is it realistic for ETH at ~$2500 to reach $5000 this year, considering macro and BTC dominance?","Hi everyone,

I’m not new to crypto, but I don’t do deep technical analysis and mostly follow news, macro trends, and Bitcoin dominance to guide my ETH decisions.

ETH is around $2500 now, and I’m considering adding to my position. I’m trying to understand if it’s realistic for ETH to reach ~$5000 within this year or if that’s too optimistic.

I’ve seen discussions about potential ETH ETFs, Bitcoin dominance possibly dropping, and the possibility of an altcoin season that could push ETH and other alts higher if BTC stabilizes or slows down. I’m also keeping an eye on the Fed, inflation data, and rate cuts, as these could influence liquidity and risk appetite for crypto.

On the other hand, I’ve heard some people mention a possible recession next year, which might impact markets or delay any strong crypto rally. I’m trying to understand how much these macro factors and BTC dominance shifts realistically influence ETH’s price in a year timeframe.

For those actively tracking ETH and market cycles, do you think a 2x this year for ETH is possible if we get a good macro environment, or is it better to have lower expectations and continue steady accumulation without hoping for a big rally?

What do you think about this onchain “Hello World” creator cult? (AI + crypto + memes),"Hey frens, curious to get your take on something I’ve been tracking lately.

It’s called **Hello World Computer** but it’s not a protocol, a product, or a polished DAO. It’s more like a memetic campfire for creators who live onchain. A collective with a token, yes, but the focus is culture > capital.



The premise is simple:

**Say hello. Every day. In public. With others.**

That’s the protocol.

What’s wild is how international and human it feels. The content isn’t algorithmic or hyper-polished, it’s raw, emotional, sometimes weird, and totally driven by AI tools, meme formats, writing, images, and shared moments.

It’s giving digital zine energy meets Ethereum spiritual layer.

No influencer farming. No engagement hacks. Just people creating and responding to each other, every day, onchain.

They’re not promising a platform. They’re not selling a roadmap.

They’re **posting conviction** and building a creator scene where the chain is the canvas.

I attached some visuals that capture the vibe. Definitely different from your average token community.



Would love honest thoughts:

 • Could something like this actually grow?

 • Does it feel like the beginning of a new kind of onchain creative movement or just a cool little niche?

 • Would you participate in something like this?

My salary has a factor of diminishing return to it, in the 1950 one dollar where something. Today it's nothing. If I would one day be payed in BTC I think the transaction between me and my customer would be free from corruption and we would get back to money backed by something tangible like gold. As it is now the only thing backing up the dollar is peoples belief that it is worth something. Sooner or later they are going to realise that it's worthless since it's corrupt.

🚧 Big Progress on the SickBuffalo.io Flagship Site. Here’s What’s Done and What’s Coming 🦬,"Over the past couple days we made a huge push forward on the future flagship site for $SICKB at sickbuffalo.io. Here’s what has been completed so far

✅ Full repo is now on GitHub, clean and ready for development
✅ Project is wired to Vercel with auto builds on commit
✅ Old PEPU elements have been removed. The new Ethereum-native $SICKB token contract is live in site code
✅ DEXTools chart is now embedded, clean and mobile-friendly
✅ Hero section spacing, flow, and buttons updated
✅ About section restructured with PEPU tokens removed and focused on the forward roadmap
✅ Contracts section updated with correct $SICKB address and ETHscan links
✅ NFT Marketplace page placeholder created and linked
✅ Admin roles and dashboard architecture reviewed with future restructure planned
✅ Wallet connection stack change is being planned from Thirdweb to Alchemy
✅ ClickUp project board is now active and tracking all development progress


What’s ahead (my roadmap)

Next step is wallet stack change, moving from Thirdweb to Alchemy

Admin roles and user roles will be restructured for DAO and future Sick Buffalo League
Dashboards will be built

Admin Dashboard for operational and content tools

Council Dashboard for governance and voting
User Dashboard for staking, governance proposals, and SPL player profiles

Marketplace development will include NFT minting, trading, and staking inside the site
Wallet connection and gated features will support profile creation, staking rewards, and SPL league participation, and moooore yuuuuge!

UI and UX refinements will come after the core stack is upgraded


My goal

This is not just a marketing site. It is the functional hub for the entire $SICKB ecosystem including DAO, SPL, staking, NFTs, marketplace, and governance.


It is already night and day compared to where we started. There is still a lot of work ahead but the foundation is strong and moving fast.


TL;DR 

We are building. The flagship site is no longer a placeholder. It is becoming the command center of the ecosystem.

🦬 SICKB is not a meme anymore. It is a machine 🦬

Buterin Says Ethereum Will Explode in 2026 – The Best ERC-20 Tokens to Buy Before Ethereum Goes 10x,"


This may be the perfect time to look into the best ERC-20 tokens to buy before Ethereum goes 10x, which is what Vitalik Buterin hinted at recently.

Buterin took the mic during the ETHGlobal Prague conference on May 30 to address some of Ethereum’s problems, which led to $ETH plummeting in the charts even when the rest of the altcoins were surging.

One of the main problems? Network congestion during high-traffic periods, which results in subpar speeds and steep fees.

According to Buterin, 2026 will be Ethereum’s year.

Buterin believes that Ethereum is at a turning point to increase its performance and productivity tenfold, and that its native token could surge in 2026:

Such an achievement could propel Ethereum into the best-performing blockchains league, allowing it to compete with the likes of Solana, which is getting an upgrade of its own in the form of the upcoming Layer-2 Solaxy ($SOLX), in terms of speed and scalability.

But while a Layer-2 upgrade could do Ethereum a lot of good in terms of performance, it would also come with a major downfall in the network’s projected market capitalization.

According to Matthew Sigel, Ethereum could lose trillions in market cap if, when adopting its Layer-2 upgrade, it fails to balance its fundamentals. This could cause the projected $ETH price of $22K by 2030 to fall more in the ballpark of $7.3K, a cut of 67%.
