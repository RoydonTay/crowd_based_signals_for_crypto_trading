Understanding about ETHT price (2x leveraged ETF on ETH price),"I'm not sure how to comprehend this fact, but back in Dec 6, 2024, the ProShares Ultra Ether ETF (ticker: ETHT) price was $170.10, while ETH future at the time was $4095 and ETH price was around $4005. Now, the ETH future was $4319 and ETH price was $4296.55 (at this moment), but the ETHT price was nowhere close to $170.10 ---> I wonder what the reason is? Because there should be an almost perfect correlation of 1.0 between ETHT price and ETH future price. Or is this ETF a scam?

What site or physical vendor lets me buy with CC in NY without >9% fees in NY?,"Coinbase removed the Credit Card option entirely due to some unsavory people using cards of people they do not know, so that's for all U.S. states.

However, I heard that other brokerages refuse CC usage if you're in NY/NYC even if it's advertised you can use it. Can someone point me to the right place where I can use a CC to purchase any crypto? I can also use cash and money order but realistically the only thing an exchange would take is a CC.

It also has to be on an exchange that gives me a seed phrase so I can ""recover"" it on a safer wallet and send it to a second wallet on the safer wallet system. I'm open to suggestions for a good safe wallet for Windows, though I think I know one already.

I can go to NJ just to log in, but if I'm making the account, it will be while I'm in NYC and also all my IDs say ""NY"" on them. :/

ETH Breakout: Is Altseason Officially Here?,"Looking at the recent performance of Ethereum (ETH), it's hard to ignore the significant upward trend! ETH is at $3,840.92 at the time of writing,  a remarkable 18.8% increase over the last year (1Y). More importantly, the current price is a strong breakout from what looked like a period of consolidation and even a dip around March-May.

This kind of strong upward movement in Ethereum is often a key indicator for the broader altcoin market. Historically, ETH has acted as a bellwether for ""Altseason"" ‚Äì a period where many alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) experience substantial gains, often outperforming Bitcoin and even Ethereum itself.

**Why is ETH's breakout relevant to Altseason?**
 **Increased Confidence:** A strong ETH signals renewed investor confidence in the smart contract platform that underpins a vast majority of altcoins, including DeFi, NFTs, and various dApps.
 **Capital Rotation:** As ETH gains momentum, profits from ETH holdings often rotate into smaller-cap altcoins, fueling their price appreciation.
 **Ecosystem Health:** ETH's strength reflects the overall health and adoption of its ecosystem, which directly benefits projects built on Ethereum.

While past performance is not indicative of future results, this strong ETH breakout definitely has the crypto community buzzing about a potential Altseason. Keep an eye on your favorite altcoins ‚Äì the tide might be turning!

Ten Years of Improving Ethereum: Key EIPs,"Here are the key Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that have significantly impacted Ethereum's development over its first decade:

* **EIP-20: Token Standard** (Adopted in 2017) : This EIP created the universal ERC-20 token standard, which streamlined token integration and catalyzed the ICO craze.
* **EIP-1559: Fee Markets** (Adopted in August 2021) : This proposal reformed Ethereum's fee market by introducing a dynamic ""base"" gas fee that is burned and an optional ""tip"" for validators, aiming to incentivize deflation and improve user experience.
* **EIP-3675: Proof-of-Stake** (also known as ""The Merge"") : This EIP replaced Ethereum's proof-of-work (PoW) with proof-of-stake (PoS), drastically reducing energy consumption and transforming ETH into a productive asset.
* **EIP-4844: L2 Blobs** (Implemented in March 2024) : This EIP introduced temporary storage space (""blobs"") for Layer 2 (L2) transaction data, significantly lowering L2 transaction costs and migrating much of Ethereum's activity to L2s.
* **EIP-3074: Wallet UX** (Merged in May 2025) : This proposal overhauled wallet functionality by giving externally owned accounts (EOAs) smart contract-like capabilities, enabling features like one-click approvals and gasless transactions to simplify the onchain experience.

ChangeNow.io Frozen My Funds - $550K. Beware of this Platform so you wont be sharing your story like I'm,"Hey Eth Community...  
honestly, i didn‚Äôt wanna have to post this but i‚Äôm kinda outta options at this point.

i used changenow a few months back to swap around $550K worth of crypto. things looked smooth at first, but right after the transaction, they asked me for full KYC, ID, source of funds, the whole deal. i gave them everything they asked for. this was back in march.

now it‚Äôs been 4 months. still no update. no refund. no answers. just complete silence.

i did some digging after things started feeling off and realized changenow is linked to changelly, and apparently they‚Äôve had a bunch of people saying the same thing happened to them. then there‚Äôs atomic wallet (same devs, i think?) that got hacked for $100M last year some ppl even think it was an inside job. Guarda also keeps promoting changenow as a trusted partner, even with all these red flags.

what really stings is that i tried everything reached out politely, followed their public instructions, even DMed them after they told me to. but no one got back. some of my posts got deleted too. i kept hoping for a fair outcome... but nothing.

i‚Äôm not here to attack anyone, i‚Äôm just genuinely stuck and hurting. that was life-changing money. and it‚Äôs just... gone.

Idea! How to solve ETH gas problem,"Many people complain about the ETH gas fees and that it is holding ETH down. 

The issue is that the low transactions pay the same fee as the big transactions. In terms of percentage its a big % for the small transaction and a tiny % for the big transaction. 

Based on the data ETH has, why dont they find out how often the small and the big transactions occur see what they can do to solve this problem? 

For example they can decrease the gas fees on the small transactions and increase it on the big transactions. In the short term they will lose money when the small transactions occur, but when the big transactions occur they will recover the losses. 

They should work around with the data and fine the Equilibrium where they dont lose money long term and make all the customers happy. 
I am sure the people who make 10k transfers wont be bothered with 10$ fees, and 100k+ transfers wont be bothered with 100$ fees. That extra charge can compensate some of the discounts given for the small transactions.  ",False,0,

Sold ETH at 3000!,"*Used AI to reframe my post*

I recently made a move in crypto and wanted to share my experience and get some thoughts. Around 4‚Äì5 months ago, I bought my first Ethereum coin (1 ETH) at $2,560. At the time, I was just getting into investing‚Äîthis year is actually my first year seriously exploring the stock market and crypto. I‚Äôm relatively young and generally believe in long-term investing, so I wasn‚Äôt planning on selling anytime soon.

That said, my ETH purchase was kind of impulsive. I saw the price drop and jumped in without too much analysis. When it fell further to around $1,500, I was obviously disappointed, but I wasn‚Äôt panicking‚ÄîI had used extra money that I didn‚Äôt urgently need, so I was mentally prepared to hold for the long term, even 5+ years if necessary.

However, when the price climbed back up and hit $3,000 recently, I decided to sell 75% of my position. My thinking was that I could potentially re-enter if the price dips again in the future. It wasn‚Äôt a panic sell‚Äîmore of a calculated exit‚Äîbut now I‚Äôm wondering if it was the right call.

Would love to hear your opinions. Also, sorry if this post seems a bit noob-ish‚Äîjust trying to learn as I go!

Ethereum Benefits in Future Update of ZOND, QRL's First Quantum Currency.

1. **Quantum-Resistant Security** ZOND QRL is designed with post-quantum cryptography at its core. This provides a high level of protection against future quantum computing threats. As Ethereum continues to grow in value and importance, collaboration or integration with quantum-resistant technologies like ZOND could help safeguard user assets in the long term.
2. **Cross-Chain Interoperability** The ZOND update improves communication capabilities with other blockchain networks, including Ethereum. This creates opportunities for secure cross-chain bridges and decentralized applications that can interact safely between both ecosystems.
3. **Advanced Smart Contract Capabilities** ZOND introduces a new layer of smart contract functionality that can serve as a secure environment for quantum-safe applications. Ethereum developers interested in post-quantum security may benefit from using or building on ZOND as an added layer of protection.
4. **Decentralization and Governance Synergy** Both Ethereum and QRL value decentralized governance. The ZOND update strengthens community-driven decision-making, providing a governance model that can inspire or collaborate with Ethereum-based DAOs.
5. **Developer Collaboration and Innovation** The upgrade creates new opportunities for developers from both communities to work together on building quantum-secure solutions, interoperability tools, and hybrid dApps that leverage the strengths of both blockchains.
6. **Future-Proofing the Ecosystem** By adopting quantum-resistant infrastructure now, ZOND QRL helps raise awareness in the broader crypto space‚Äîincluding Ethereum‚Äîabout the importance of preparing for quantum threats. This benefits the entire blockchain community by encouraging proactive security development.
7. **With the launch of ZOND, the QRL quantumcurrency will be listed on major Tier 1 exchanges.**

# QRL Zond ‚Äì The Upgrade Ethereum Needs for the Post-Quantum Era

The Ethereum community has always led the charge in blockchain innovation: smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs ‚Äì all born from a bold and visionary ecosystem. But a new era is approaching ‚Äì the **era of quantum computing**, which poses a real threat to the cryptographic foundations that blockchains like Ethereum rely on.

Enter **QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger)** with its groundbreaking **Zond upgrade** ‚Äì the world‚Äôs first **post-quantum, EVM-compatible chain**. This is where Ethereum‚Äôs community should pay close attention ‚Äî not to see QRL as a competitor, but as a **critical ally**.

# What Does Zond Change?

1. **Quantum Resistance Built In** Zond uses quantum-resistant cryptography (XMSS), protecting against quantum threats *today* ‚Äî not in theory, but in practice. Ethereum, as powerful as it is, still relies on ECDSA ‚Äì an algorithm that *will* be vulnerable to quantum attacks.
2. **Full EVM Compatibility** Zond allows smart contracts written for Ethereum to run seamlessly. Developers from the Ethereum ecosystem can build on Zond using the same tools they already know ‚Äî but now with post-quantum security.
3. **Future-Proof Infrastructure** QRL isn‚Äôt just preparing for the future ‚Äî it‚Äôs **building** it. With Zond, any Ethereum project can instantly gain quantum resistance without sacrificing flexibility or familiarity.

# Why Ethereum and QRL Should Move Forward Together

Ethereum is the most dominant force in Web3. But with dominance comes the responsibility to **secure the foundation**. This is where QRL steps in ‚Äî as a shield, a bridge, and a partner.

By investing in QRL, the Ethereum community is not just diversifying ‚Äî it's **future-proofing**. It's supporting innovation that *enhances* Ethereum‚Äôs reach and resilience.

# What Can You Do Today?

* **Deploy** a smart contract on Zond ‚Äî porting from Ethereum takes minutes.
* **Consider** allocating part of your ETH portfolio into QRL ‚Äî as a strategic hedge.
* **Learn** more about quantum-resistant cryptography ‚Äî because the future is approaching fast.

**QRL Zond isn‚Äôt an alternative to Ethereum ‚Äî it‚Äôs an enhancement.**

"The First created quantumcurrency appreciated by the largest defense corporation in the world - Lockheed Martin, will cooperate with Ethereum","This is a compelling development that Ethereum folks shouldn‚Äôt overlook.

QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger) was built from the ground up with quantum resistance in mind - unlike most other chains, which are now trying to retrofit that protection. With the Zond upgrade, QRL becomes the first EVM-compatible, post-quantum secure blockchain, meaning Ethereum developers can port smart contracts over with little to no friction while gaining quantum resistance from day one.

The timing is important. NIST has already selected post-quantum algorithms for standardization, and nation-state interest in quantum computing (like China's) is not slowing down. Projects like QRL have been preparing for this moment for years.

Seeking Advice: Securely Withdrawing ETH from an Old Smart Contract (Avoiding Front-Running),"Back in 2019, my brother created a learning project and sent me 2 ETH, locking it in a simple Solidity smart contract as a kind of ""puzzle vault.""

The purpose was educational. The contract uses a passphrase mechanism and a unlock condition:

**Unlocking Conditions:**

To successfully withdraw the ETH, the caller must:

1. Know the original passphrase (which I do), and
2. Send at least twice the contract's current ETH balance in the same transaction.

Here‚Äôs the contract for reference:

    pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
    
    contract HiddenVault {
        bytes32 private hashedSecret;
    
        constructor(bytes32 _hashedSecret) public payable {
            hashedSecret = _hashedSecret;
        }
    
        function unlock(bytes memory passphrase) public payable {
            uint256 vaultBalance = address(this).balance - msg.value;
            require(msg.value >= vaultBalance * 2, ""Insufficient collateral"");
            require(sha256(passphrase) == hashedSecret, ""Wrong passphrase"");
            selfdestruct(msg.sender);
        }
    }

**My Concern:**

The current balance is 2 ETH, so to meet the contract‚Äôs conditions I would need to send 4 ETH in the same transaction. If successful, the contract would self-destruct and transfer the total (6 ETH) to the caller (me), per its logic.

**Questions:**

1. Is Flashbots Protect RPC the best approach to prevent this kind of front-running?
3. How risk is do execute this contract? Can I be 100% sure I wont lose any eth?
3. Has anyone handled similar unlock patterns recently? I‚Äôd appreciate any advice on gas settings, transaction bundles, or examples.",False,2,

Tom Lee‚Äôs Investment Thesis,"Lee‚Äôs thesis is that large banks like JPM and BofA will issue stablecoins and buy ETH to stake. Doesn‚Äôt this diminish the point of decentralization? Isn‚Äôt that the primary benefit that Ethereum has clung too over the years?

He said nothing about increased fee revenue, likely because L2s efficiency gains will offset the increased volume. Ethereum‚Äôs network usage (mainnet) has declined in 2025, leading to lower transaction volumes and gas fees. For example, in March 2025, the daily burn volume hit an all-time low of 53.07 ETH.

Can someone explain to me what will drive value if increased usage, primarily on L2s, won‚Äôt drive significant fee revenue? 

Banks accumulating and staking ETH would impact supply and demand dynamics but at the cost of decentralization. Additionally banks staking large amounts of ETH to secure the network for their stablecoins would reduce the yield for staking ETH. Is Lee‚Äôs thesis sound?

"[ discussion ] Is it realistic for ETH at ~$2500 to reach $5000 this year, considering macro and BTC dominance?","Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm not new to crypto, but I don‚Äôt do deep technical analysis and mostly follow news, macro trends, and Bitcoin dominance to guide my ETH decisions.

ETH is around $2500 now, and I‚Äôm considering adding to my position. I‚Äôm trying to understand if it‚Äôs realistic for ETH to reach ~$5000 within this year or if that‚Äôs too optimistic.

I‚Äôve seen discussions about potential ETH ETFs, Bitcoin dominance possibly dropping, and the possibility of an altcoin season that could push ETH and other alts higher if BTC stabilizes or slows down. I‚Äôm also keeping an eye on the Fed, inflation data, and rate cuts, as these could influence liquidity and risk appetite for crypto.

On the other hand, I‚Äôve heard some people mention a possible recession next year, which might impact markets or delay any strong crypto rally. I‚Äôm trying to understand how much these macro factors and BTC dominance shifts realistically influence ETH‚Äôs price in a year timeframe.

For those actively tracking ETH and market cycles, do you think a 2x this year for ETH is possible if we get a good macro environment, or is it better to have lower expectations and continue steady accumulation without hoping for a big rally?

The steps and amounts shown (e.g., 2.7999 SOL) suggest this might be a batch payout or smart contract execution. Also, the left-hand menu has a ""Wallet"" option (not sure which crypto wallet this is), which further points to this being some kind of crypto management tool.

* Testing or executing smart contract code.

ETH discussion,"What up Dudes and Dudettes!

The price of ETH is crashing again due to war breaking out in the Middle East. 

Yes, i know that the Ethereum blockchain does so much more than what the Bitcoin Blockchain can every do. (Digital Oil). 

Smart contracts, the tokenization of real world assets, giving people the ability to buy up Real Estate or other physically assets overseas without acutally having to go there in person, still the majority of DeFI is all based on the Ethereum Blockchain.

The Ethereum Blockchain just went throught the
Pectra upgrade,  this giving it increased scalability and making it easier for the developers to build on. 

I have also noticed the Gas fees to using the Ethereum Blockchain have drop significantly, making it more attractive to use. 

But my main question is:
When do the developers make the next killer app on the Ethereum Blockchain which really gives it some real world use cases, something that the common person in the streets will be using?? Developers have been building on the Ethereum Blockchain for over 10 years now, I mean WFT!

The more people that use the Blockchain, hopefully price go up?

"""Ethereum reste-t-il le meilleur choix face √† Solana et Cardano ?""","Salut √† tous les passionn√©s de crypto ! üåê‚ú®

Ethereum, c'est un peu le grand fr√®re de la blockchain, non ? Depuis son lancement en 2015, il a r√©volutionn√© le monde des contrats intelligents et des DApps. Mais avec la mont√©e en puissance de concurrents comme Solana et Cardano, est-ce qu'Ethereum reste le roi incontest√© ? üèÜ

Le passage √† Ethereum 2.0 avec le Proof of Stake promet des transactions plus rapides et moins √©nergivores, mais les mises √† jour sont lentes et les frais de gaz restent un sujet de d√©bat. üí∏üî•

Et vous, qu'en pensez-vous ? Ethereum est-il toujours le meilleur choix pour les d√©veloppeurs et les investisseurs, ou est-il temps de regarder ailleurs ? Partagez vos avis et exp√©riences ! üí¨
