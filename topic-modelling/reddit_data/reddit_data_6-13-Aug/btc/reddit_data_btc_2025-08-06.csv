SEC’s Crypto Task Force Will Tour U.S. to Hear From Small Startups on Policy Reform,https://peakd.com/hive-167922/@justmythoughts/sec-s-crypto-task-force,False,2.0
bros keep telling me to switch from btc but early 2025 just proved why bitcoin's security model is superior,"been seeing a lot of posts lately about moving from bitcoin to eth for ""higher returns"" but honestly the recent events have me more convinced than ever that bitcoin's approach is the right one

yeah ethereum might pump harder sometimes but look what happened in early 2025 - billions got drained in that massive hack. meanwhile bitcoin's network just keeps chugging along like it has for 15+ years without a single successful direct attack on the protocol itself

the complexity argument is real. ethereum's got all these smart contracts and defi protocols creating endless attack vectors. every new feature is another potential way for someone to find an exploit and drain funds. bitcoin keeps it simple - peer to peer electronic cash, nothing fancy, nothing that can blow up in your face

and don't get me started on the regulatory stuff. sure ethereum got some wins with things like the genius act, but all that defi integration means way more regulatory surface area. one bad policy decision and the whole ecosystem could get hammered. bitcoin's just digital money - harder for governments to mess with without looking completely authoritarian

look i get it, ethereum has its place and the tech is impressive. but when people say ""move from bitcoin to eth for gains"" they're basically saying ""give up the most secure, battle-tested network for something flashier""

not saying ethereum is going to zero or anything, but calling bitcoin ""outdated"" while ethereum is getting billions stolen feels pretty backwards to me

"why bitcoin is the first choice for institutional treasuries, according to the numbers that actually matter","been thinking about what makes bitcoin the obvious pick for serious institutional money after seeing all these corporate treasury adoptions accelerate. the data tells a pretty clear story about why companies choose btc over everything else when they want to store real value.

the track record speaks for itself: bitcoin has been running for 16+ years without a single day of downtime. no rollbacks, no emergency shutdowns, no ""we need to pause the network"" moments. when microstrategy puts $42 billion into btc, they're betting on that reliability continuing forever.

the security model is unmatched: over $2 trillion in market cap secured by the most robust proof of work network ever built. hundreds of thousands of miners across every continent making it literally impossible to attack or control. institutions understand that this isn't just marketing, it's mathematical certainty.

no counterparty risk: when tesla buys bitcoin, they're not trusting any company, foundation, or development team to keep their money safe. they're trusting pure mathematics and thermodynamics. no single point of failure, no ceo that can change the rules, no governance token that can vote to confiscate funds.

the adoption metrics are wild:

$150+ billion in corporate treasuries (microstrategy, tesla, mara, etc)

spot etfs holding over $100 billion in just the first year

entire countries using it as legal tender

pension funds and insurance companies allocating billions

what institutions actually care about: forget smart contracts and defi yields. corporations want digital gold that can't be debased, confiscated, or controlled by any government or entity. bitcoin delivers exactly that and nothing else comes close to the same level of certainty.

the network effects are accelerating: every major bank now offers bitcoin services. payment processors integrate btc by default. accounting firms understand how to handle it. the infrastructure exists for institutions to buy, hold, and use bitcoin without technical complexity.

monetary policy you can audit: 21 million bitcoin, period. no inflation beyond the predetermined schedule that ends in 2140. institutions can literally verify the entire monetary policy by running the code. try doing that with any fiat currency or alternative crypto.

why this matters going forward: we're watching the transition from ""bitcoin is risky speculation"" to ""bitcoin is essential treasury infrastructure."" once institutions realize they can store value in something that can't be printed, debased, or controlled, the adoption becomes inevitable.

the numbers don't lie. corporate treasuries are voting with billions of dollars and they're choosing bitcoin over everything else for long term value storage. that tells you everything about where this is heading.

Well, alright. Would you care to demonstrate how a sufficient Security Budget could be maintained going forward ?

What is your estimate for a Security Budget, in say, 10-15 years.  Sufficient to pay for enough mining activity to keep the chain secure ?

Would you agree… say $20 to $30 Million per day ?  Perhaps $10 B per year.

3. Troll the skeptics to death, even if they’re right. Don’t admit any flaw – when in doubt, refer to commandment one. 

4. Slay your idols. Well, except for the high priests who get a free pass for shitcoining. They are cool, at least until Mr. Hodl or Giacomo tells you that they’re not. 

5. Anyone who uses the Bitcoin codebase to build anything without the blessing of Blockstream is a shitcoiner who deserves to get slain. 

6. Liquid is a sidechain and Lightning is the one true way to scale Bitcoin. Anyone claiming otherwise is a shitcoiner who deserves to get slain. 

7. Ethereum is a bigger enemy than bankers, politicians & spooks infiltrated within the community. Make fun of Ethereum at least 3 times a week, then praise JP Morgan, the Trump family and BlackRock for being such bitcoin bulls.

8. The community is decentralized and diverse, so nobody speaks for Bitcoin except for Greg Maxwell and 3 other guys who can effectively shut down initiatives to improve the project. You think Bitcoin needs improvements? Refer to commandment no. 1!

9. If you came to Bitcoin in 2017 or later, you’re a pleb and you will always be a pleb. Be happy about it pleb, embrace the name and never question your OG overlords.

david bailey wants to raise $200m pac to push bitcoin to $10 million and abolish capital gains tax on btc sales,"david bailey just announced plans to raise a $100m to $200m political action committee focused entirely on advancing bitcoin interests in the us. this is the same guy who advised trump on bitcoin policy and basically orchestrated the entire political pivot that got us a pro crypto administration.

the scope of this pac is massive: bailey wants to anchor it through nakamoto holdings, his $300 million bitcoin treasury company. but the goals he outlined are way more ambitious than typical crypto lobbying. we're talking about fundamentally changing how america treats bitcoin.

primary objectives include:

pushing bitcoin price to $10 million (yes, he actually said this)

positioning bitcoin for long term dominance

abolishing capital gains tax on bitcoin sales

protecting self custody rights

legal protections for open source bitcoin developers

community suggestions are getting wild: stephan livera wants complete elimination of capital gains on btc. alex gladstein from human rights foundation is pushing for bitcoin debt payments from foreign countries, high school bitcoin education funding, and developer protection laws.

tuur demeester went even further, calling for full reserve banking requirements where banks must hold 100% of customer deposits in reserve. that would basically end fractional reserve banking as we know it.

this is different from previous crypto lobbying: fairshake pac spent $130 million in 2024 elections but focused on general crypto friendly candidates. bailey's pac would be bitcoin specific and aims to reshape fundamental economic policy around btc.

the fact that someone with direct trump administration connections is talking about $10 million bitcoin targets through political action tells you how seriously they're taking bitcoin's role in future policy.

potential concerns: charles allen from btcs warned bailey about fiduciary duty issues since he's using public company resources for political efforts. there's a real legal risk if shareholders think corporate funds are being misused for political activism.

bailey's response was that coinbase backed fairshake without issues, but allen pointed out that might not make sense in a pro crypto environment where corporate political spending isn't necessary.

the bigger picture: crypto companies spent $134 million on 2024 elections and won big. now we have elected officials who are actually pro bitcoin instead of just tolerating crypto. bailey sees this as the moment to push for structural changes while we have political momentum.

fairshake still has $141 million ready for future elections, but bailey's pac would be laser focused on bitcoin specific policy changes rather than general crypto acceptance.

what this could mean: if bailey successfully raises $200m and focuses it entirely on bitcoin policy priorities, we could see actual legislation around capital gains elimination, self custody protection, and bitcoin reserve banking requirements.

the $10 million price target isn't just speculation anymore when someone with this level of political access is building a war chest specifically to make it happen through policy changes.

this fibonacci model has called every bitcoin move since $15k and says $166k is next...the math is actually scary accurate,"been diving into this fibonacci analysis from cryptocon and honestly, the pattern recognition is wild. this guy has been tracking btc since the ftx bottom at $15.5k and every major move has hit fibonacci extensions almost perfectly.

here's how it's played out since 2022:

$15,500 (cycle bottom after ftx collapse)

$30,362 (1.618 fib extension) - hit in april 2023, consolidation

$46,831 (2.618 extension) - hit january 2024, became support

$71,591 (3.618 extension) - touched march/june 2024, rejected twice

$109,236 (4.618 extension) - broken january 2025

next target: $166,754 (5.618 extension)

the spacing between these levels has been incredibly consistent. each leg up was around 52-54% gains before consolidation. we're currently sitting around $114k, which puts us in the transition zone between 4.618 and 5.618.

this isn't just technical hopium either:
every previous bitcoin cycle topped near specific fibonacci levels. 2013 peaked at the 5.618 extension around $1,150. 2017 hit just past 4.618 near $20k. even 2021's ""irregular"" cycle topped at $69k, which was almost exactly the 3.618 extension from 2018 lows.

the fundamental backdrop supports it:

post-halving dynamics still playing out (we're 16 months in)

etfs now hold $150b in assets (6.5% of total btc market cap)

regulatory clarity improving with genius act passing

strategic bitcoin reserve pilot program approved

but there are warning signs:
benjamin cowen points out that every post-halving year sees july/august gains followed by september corrections. we just had a 7.22% july gain, so if the pattern holds, we might see a pullback next month.

another analyst noted that profit-taking metrics are forming lower highs, suggesting each rally faces stronger selling pressure. we might get two more legs up before the cycle peaks.

what's interesting is the institutional component:
previous cycles were retail-driven. this one has blackrock holding 740k btc and institutions controlling 1 in every 15 bitcoin in circulation. that's a completely different market structure that could support higher prices.

the $166k target isn't some random moonshot number - it's where the math says we should go if this pattern continues. whether we get there in one shot or with corrections along the way is the real question.

the $112k dip might have been the best thing that happened to bitcoin... cause this setup looks too good to ignore,"just saw some interesting analysis about this weekend's btc dump to $112k and honestly, it might have been exactly what we needed. instead of freaking out about the selloff, let me break down why this could actually be setting up for a serious recovery.

the ""power of 3"" pattern is playing out perfectly: we've seen the classic accumulation phase ($119k-$115k), then manipulation (the dump to $112k), and now we might be entering distribution toward $126k. this isn't random, it's how institutional money operates while retail panics.

$922 million liquidation event cleared the deck: this was the biggest liquidation since february with $240m in btc futures alone. open interest dropped from $88b to $79b. when this much leverage gets flushed out, it removes the overhang that was keeping price suppressed.

funding rates flipped negative across exchanges: binance, bitmex, deribit all showing negative funding. that means shorts are paying longs to keep positions open. when retail is this bearish after a correction, it's usually time to start thinking contrarian.

binance taker volume hit -$1.5b: this level of aggressive selling hasn't been seen since july 25th. it's classic retail behavior - buy the top, sell the bottom. the panic selling around $114k was probably the capitulation we needed.

technical levels are lining up: the $112k-$115k zone was a major fair value gap that got filled. we bounced off the previous ath from may which is now acting as support. if we can reclaim $115.3k and $116.8k, $120k becomes a magnet with all that liquidation cluster sitting there.

why this feels different: previous corrections this cycle were about uncertainty. this one feels like a reset. leverage got flushed, weak hands got shaken out, and funding rates reset. the market structure actually looks healthier now than before the dump.

we're sitting around $114k right now but the signs are pointing toward a bounce. when you combine technical rebound signals with sentiment washing out and leverage being cleared, you get the setup for sustained moves higher.

not saying we're immediately going to $126k, but this correction might have done exactly what was needed to continue the bull market instead of ending it.

From CFDs to real Bitcoin,"Not sure if it’s for this sub, but here we go.

A few years back, I got into BTC through eToro, but only with CFDs. At the time, it seemed the easiest way, and as a beginner, I didn’t know what spreads were, let alone that eToro’s spreads are much higher than most real crypto exchanges. I paid extra for that, but the returns have been great so I didn’t really care at the time.

Now I want to actually own my BTC. My plan is to sell the CFDs, withdraw to my bank, buy real BTC (only BTC) through an exchange, and then move it to my own wallet.

Timing is always a bit of a gamble, since I could end up selling during a local peak and buying back during a dip, or the other way around. I know there’s never a perfect moment, but I want to be in control and accept that risk.

A few things I’m still unsure about:

•	⁠Hardware wallet, or would you trust a good software wallet for long-term holding and why?
•	⁠For a EU resident, which exchange would you recommend for buying real BTC?
•	⁠Are there important things to keep in mind during this migration, like fees, taxes, timing, or risks that I might not be thinking of? For example, I’m aware that there are conversion costs when selling on eToro and moving funds to euro, plus their spread is pretty steep compared to most exchanges, and there are also network fees when sending BTC to my own wallet.
•	⁠Is there any reason not to go full self-custody, or any alternatives worth considering?

Balancing maxi brain with degen curiosity: how do you keep your BTC conviction while still poking around new-launch land?,"The sub is having another round of soul-searching about ""Bitcoin’s lost its way,"" institutional custody, KYC creep, you name it. I’m firmly in the self-custody, long-term-savings camp, but I’ll be honest: I still wander off-trail to scout fresh Sol/Base memes for fun money. The problem is information overload. If you scroll CT or DEX feeds for ten minutes, every new cartoon dog is ""the future of payments,"" and suddenly my hard-earned sats start to look… slow.

So I split my headspace into two lanes:

* Core stack: hardware wallet, no rehypothecation, DCA, ignore the price until the next halving.
* Curiosity sandbox: tiny allocation I can literally afford to round down to zero. For that I run a saved filter in BananaGun Pro that surfaces sub-five-minute launches so I can scratch the degen itch quickly, then rotate any winnings back into BTC cold storage.

Keeping the buckets separate has two nice side effects:

1. It reminds me how calm Bitcoin actually is, ten minutes in launch-chart hell makes one-block confirmations feel like a spa day.
2. When a meme goes 5x and I swap it into sats, it reinforces the ""BTC as base unit"" mindset instead of letting me spiral into unit bias.

Questions for the hive mind:

⁠> Do you maintain a similar sandbox, or is it 100 % orange-pilled monk mode?

No, I’m interested in using Bitcoin as permission-less P2P cash, that’s what grabbed my attention.
I used to own BTC back when fees were always super low and it actually looked like it could be the future of payments.

BTC has a stupid CAGR, which by low estimates is 30%… that means, if you put 25k into BTC on a 30 % CAGR, it’ll be worth over a million in 10 years, and closer to 2 million in like 12 years… if the CAGR cuts in half immediately even, it’d still be more than 30.

"btc hodlers are panic selling into binance at 7k btc per day while whales dump everything, this selloff is different","been watching the onchain data and this selloff is way nastier than the price action suggests. short-term holders just dumped 40k btc at a loss in 24 hours - that's the most panic selling since july 15th. meanwhile binance is seeing 7k btc inflows daily, up from 5.3k just a month ago.

here's what's actually happening:

the exchange whale ratio spiked above 0.70, meaning most of these deposits are coming from whales, not retail. when big money starts dumping this hard, especially on weekends when liquidity is thin, you know something's wrong.

august 1st alone saw 16,417 btc in net inflows to exchanges. that's not normal weekend flow - that's institutional money bailing out before monday.

the timing tells the whole story:

this started when btc first broke $110k in early july. since then, we've seen a steady increase in selling pressure that everyone ignored because price kept going up. but now the dam is breaking.

what's scary is this isn't just retail getting shaken out. the us bitcoin etfs had $812 million in outflows on august 1st - the second largest daily drawdown ever. institutional money is running for the exits alongside the whales.

analyst skew pointed out something interesting:

the weekend order book activity was ""not your average weekend price action."" large players were quoting massive size just to facilitate their exits without completely crashing the market. that takes serious money.

we're sitting at $114k right now but the flow data suggests this bounce is temporary. when you have 7k btc hitting binance daily and whales dominating the deposits, the path of least resistance is down.

the market structure has completely flipped since july. before that, inflows were declining for months - classic accumulation phase. now we're seeing the reverse as smart money distributed into retail fomo.

what's different this time:

institutional money is selling alongside whales

short-term holders are capitulating at losses

exchange flows show sustained selling pressure, not just volatility

weekend dumping suggests urgency, not planned profit-taking

this feels like the start of a deeper correction, not just a dip. when whales and institutions both head for the exits at the same time, retail usually gets left holding the bag.

Some advice. When you start keep your BTC on the exchange. The exchange account is safe enough for these amounts, and going full in with your own wallet has many risks in its own and any mistake with your own wallet risks you permanently losing your coins.

The exchange account is like a bank account. Quite well protected but in the hands of the exchange and not really your coins.

Having the coins in your own wallet is like withdrawing cash. You are fully responsible for managing the coins and no one will guard you from doing stupid things.

When you approach about 0.05 BTC then start looking into setting up your own wallet for long term use.

Until then take your time and learn more about what Bitcoin is. Set up a soft wallet on your mobile and one on your computer to play around with and learn the basics, but transfer only a very small amount there and let the rest stay on the exchange until you are ready to set up your real wallet.",True,1.0

"Arthur Hayes just dumped $13M in crypto and thinks BTC is heading back to $100k, here's why he might be right","Arthur Hayes dropped some serious FUD yesterday and honestly, his track record makes it worth paying attention to. The BitMEX founder just offloaded over $13 million worth of ETH, ENA, and PEPE, then warned that Bitcoin could retrace all the way back to $100k.

His reasoning? The macro picture is getting ugly fast.

July jobs report was absolute trash, only 73k new jobs when we needed way more

Credit growth is basically dead across major economies

GDP growth is stalling out everywhere you look

Tariff fears are ramping up again

Hayes isn't some random Twitter analyst either. When this guy moves $13M out of crypto positions and goes 81% cash (mostly USDC), you pay attention. His wallet now sits at $28.3M with $22.95M parked in stablecoins.

What a $100k Bitcoin would mean: That's an 18.7% correction from the $123k high we hit in July. Not exactly moon mission territory, but also not the end of the world. BTC has already dropped 7.7% from that peak, so we're partway there.

The interesting part is how divided people are on this. You've got Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas pointing out that Bitcoin volatility has been way more tame since the ETF approvals. Mitchell Askew from Blockware is saying the days of brutal bear markets are over.

But Hayes is looking at the bigger picture - when credit tightens and jobs disappear, risk assets get hammered. Doesn't matter if institutions are buying if the macro environment goes to shit.

My take: Hayes has been through multiple cycles and made bank timing these moves. If he's this bearish while sitting on a massive cash position, maybe it's time to at least consider that this bull run might need to take a breather.

The question isn't whether Bitcoin survives (it will), but whether we're about to see that classic macro-driven correction that reminds everyone crypto still moves with risk-on sentiment. Either way, gonna need awaken.tax working overtime if we're about to see some serious volatility and tax-loss harvesting opportunities.

Is buying prepaid eSIMs with Bitcoin a convenience win or fee trap?,"I’ve started experimenting with paying for travel data straight in BTC instead of messing with airport kiosks. Last month I bought a 5 GB UK eSIM through Prestmit and the whole checkout settled in satoshis: the QR code landed in my inbox before my coffee cooled. It felt pretty slick, but here’s what I’m still unsure about:

* Spread vs on-chain fee: The price was roughly spot +1.8 %, which beats some card FX rates, yet the miner fee that day nudged the total higher than a debit card would have.
* Liquidity risk: They auto-convert to local currency on their end, so I didn’t chase a buyer, but I wonder how sustainable that is if BTC drops 10 % mid-flight.
* Refunds/chargebacks: If the eSIM fails to activate, there’s no card dispute, just support tickets and hoping for a manual BTC return.

Is buying prepaid eSIMs with Bitcoin a convenience win or fee trap?,"A better way to spend crypto and not care about the price differences mid flight is to spend and replace. Purchase the esim, and right after purchase the same amount of BTC you spent with your exchange account. This drives adoption and usage of crypto.

The problem with BTC is that if everyone starts actually using BTC the way it was meant - as a peer-to-peer cash, rather than buying and holding and waiting for number to go up and sell back to government fiat - tx fees will go through the roof making it not plausible to use as P2P cash. So everyone then uses lightning network which is the great savior, but then it becomes peer-to-third party financial institution-to-peer electronic cash and at that point just use paypal or zelle.

BCH fixes this problem, tx fees always stay low, and remains peer-to-peer electronic cash without the need to trust third parties who charge fees and will censor you if you don't think the right thoughts.",True,2.0

Blockchain.com Transaction on Pending Issue,"Hi everyone, I know this is a long message but would really appreciate a read if you have a minute.

Really new to this subreddit but didn’t know where else to turn regarding my situation with blockchain.com as starting to get really concerned. However, thought somebody on here might have a better idea than myself on how to deal with this situation.

I have been having trouble regarding a transaction made through my blockchain account. I am purchasing a product and paying the receiver in cryptocurrency (the chosen being BTC.)
I have had no issues previously with sending Bitcoin out of the account and usually a transaction would be complete within the space of 10-20 minutes.

However my last transaction made on Thursday 24th July 2025 at 17:35pm BST has still yet to be complete as of this time of writing and sat on pending.

Obviously it is concerning for myself as this money has left my account and currently has not arrived in the destination wallet.

Any idea as to why this is the case and what I can do to solve it would be greatly appreciated.
I have been in contact with customer support to try and resolve the situation and only receiving generic copy and paste messages.

FED interest rates are actually set by the President of the NY Fed branch―unilaterally. 

The Fed Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes **recommendations** for what rates should be, but the President of the NY FED serves at the pleasure of the Directors of the NY FED and doesn't have to follow the recommendation of the FOMC.

It's for this reason that the largest banks (Chase & Citi, etc) are ALWAYS the largest shareholders of the NY FED. They essentially, secretly, own a controlling interest on monetary policy in the US. 

So if an Autocrat wanted to zero out interest rates at the FED, they don't have to worry about the overall FED Chairman, or the FOMC folks, or anyone serving at the FED really. 

A $5 wrench attack can be accomplished on the Federal Reserve just by hitting up the heads of the banks that are the majority shareholders at the NY FED.

Bitcoin Has Lost Its Way...,"A lot of people think my interview with Roger Ver was a turning point when I left the church of Bitcoin maximalism 

In fact, I started questioning it when the culture became obviously non-libertarian during the pandemic

Asking Gary Gensler’s SEC to label everything other than BTC as an unregistered security

Defending KYC & weird surveillance practices, by saying that at least the service is “Bitcoin only and doesn’t support any shitcoin”

Slaying guys like Andreas Antonopoulos who honestly is the reason many of us stuck around

Pushing idiots with nothing interesting to say to speak on conference stages just because they are “bullish”

Shitting on projects that have been nothing but nice and supportive to Bitcoin (Litecoin, Zcash) and others that do what Bitcoin cannot (Ethereum, Monero)

Replacing reason with dogma and enforcing everything with a weird sense of self-confidence that stalls progress

Acting like any network upgrade is an attack, despite intensive testing on other compatible networks 

Vilifying developers to the point that they ragequit to build something else, while those who stay are incentivized to play along with the meme culture just to earn a paycheck 

Worshipping Saylor, who is against the values of Bitcoin’s early days

Sucking up to politicians and selling out to government agencies because “everything is good for Bitcoin” and “Honeybadger don’t care”

Pretending that a federation like Liquid is decentralized and the L-BTC token is actually bitcoin (the market chose Ethereum for this use case, lol)

Repeating lies about Lightning Network’s success, when the project has been stagnating in terms of liquidity for years

Acting like bitcoin adoption in El Salvador (mostly custodial, surveilled by the state) is going the way it’s supposed to and other countries should copy the same example 

Looking the other way while bitcoin payments get replaced by stablecoins and BTC adoption was in fact higher a decade ago

Changing history and erasing the contributions of OGs only to appeal to institutional investors that may make the number go up (who still remembers Gavin Andresen or Mike Hearn?)

Making up narratives on the go, manufacturing fake news in order to manipulate the market sentiment and get another pump

Suppressing conversations about serious improvement proposals, which would help Bitcoin scale to 8 billion people and offer monetary fungibility 

Keeping builders away from Bitcoin with a hostile and cocky attitude which assumes victory before any significant battle has been won

Not giving a fuck about the disappearance of privacy products & research (Ethereum raised millions of dollars to defend the Tornado Cash devs, while bitcoiners simply shrugged when Samourai devs got arrested)

Normalizing a culture of complacency where you’re afraid of saying something wrong (or even remotely different from the social consensus) because you might just be excommunicated 

Promoting sheepish mediocrity while pushing away radical reformists (Paul Sztorc, Jeremy Rubin)

Forgetting history (today was UASF day, does anyone still remember?)

Never giving the benefit of the doubt to other networks that build cool shit, only because they have tokens which compete with bitcoin.

"metaplanet just announced $3.7 billion bitcoin treasury raise, asia's corporate btc accumulation getting serious","so japan's metaplanet (known as ""asia's microstrategy"") just dropped news that they're raising 555 billion yen ($3.7 billion) through preferred shares to buy more bitcoin. their target? 210,000 btc by end of 2027.

this is actually huge for several reasons:

the scale is insane we're talking about a japanese company planning to acquire 1% of bitcoin's entire supply over the next 3 years. at current prices that's around $25 billion worth of btc they want to accumulate. for context, microstrategy has 607,000 btc after years of buying.

**the funding structure is smart** they're issuing perpetual preferred shares with up to 6% annual dividend. basically letting investors get exposure to their bitcoin strategy while collecting yield. this is the same playbook saylor pioneered but adapted for japanese capital markets.

corporate treasury trend accelerating this announcement came right after crypto treasury firms hit $100 billion collectively, with $93 billion of that in bitcoin. we're watching the institutionalization of btc happen in real time across different continents.

timing with macro conditions matrixport's research suggests bitcoin's next major catalyst could hit in september when congress reconvenes and fiscal uncertainty returns. historically that's been massive for hard assets, and now we have corporate treasuries positioned to absorb any supply.

the supply math is brutal between microstrategy continuing to buy, metaplanet targeting 210k btc, and dozens of other corporate treasuries accumulating, the available supply for retail is shrinking fast. when you factor in etf inflows and mining rewards getting absorbed, we're looking at a legitimate supply crunch.

validation of the treasury model seeing a major japanese firm copy microstrategy's playbook validates that this isn't just one crazy ceo's strategy. it's becoming a legitimate corporate finance approach across different regulatory environments and cultures.

the fact that metaplanet is calling themselves ""asia's microstrategy"" shows how normalized this bitcoin treasury strategy has become. what started as saylor's unconventional experiment is now being replicated by institutions worldwide.

if metaplanet successfully raises this $3.7 billion and executes their plan, we could see other asian companies follow suit. south korea, singapore, taiwan - imagine if corporate bitcoin adoption spreads across the entire region.

the september fiscal uncertainty catalyst matrixport mentioned could be perfect timing for these treasury companies to deploy fresh capital. congress returning to debates about debt ceiling and spending could drive institutional money into bitcoin just as these companies have maximum firepower.

anyone else seeing how this corporate accumulation trend changes the entire bitcoin landscape? feels like we're past the point of no return on institutional adoption.",False,4.0

Buying with CC in New York?,"Coinbase removed the Credit Card option entirely due to some unsavory people using cards of people they do not know, so that's for all U.S. states.

However, I heard that other brokerages refuse CC usage if you're in NY/NYC even if it's advertised you can use it. Can someone point me to the right place where I can use a CC to purchase any crypto? I can also use cash and money order but realistically the only thing an exchange would take is a CC. 

It also has to be on an exchange that gives me a seed phrase so I can ""recover"" it on a safer wallet and send it to a second wallet on the safer wallet system. I'm open to suggestions for a good safe wallet for Windows, though I think I know one already.

Honestly, no legit seller should accept CC for crypto without a pre-existing business relationship with the customer or long time delays. CC tx can be reversed. Cryptocurrency ones cannot. So they'd be taking on a lot of unnecessary risk.

The only safe wallet is Bitcoin Core. But bear in mind that is going to require a long sycnig process and lots of hard drive space (about a half a terabyte last I checked).


I don't know of any exchange that is going to give you a Bitcoin seed phrase. There would never be any legitimate reason for you and your exchange to share private keys, which this would imply. Instead, to save long term, you should generate your own seed wallet then send the Bitcoin from the exchange to your wallet.

I think nowadays all American exchanges have to report to the IRS, but not necessarily to you. Keep track. I don't recommend making a ton of trades until you figure out if they're going to send you a form.

The Court Finally Approved the Settlement Between Singularity and its Investors After Crypto Pivot Scandal,"Hey guys, if you missed it, Singularity Future Technology ($SGLY), formerly Sino-Global, has agreed to settle $3M with investors over hiding key info during its 2021 pivot from shipping to cryptocurrency hardware. And the court finally approved the agreement. So, here’s a quick recap.



In early 2021, the company rebranded itself as a blockchain and crypto hardware player, claiming proprietary mining rigs and large-scale partnerships. $SGLY jumped after announcements of server purchases and joint ventures like Thor Miner and a $200M deal with SOS. Later, it claimed a $250M partnership with Golden Mainland.



But by mid-2022, Hindenburg and Peabody exposed major red flags showing that Thor Miner had no proprietary products, Golden Mainland had a fake address, and the entire crypto strategy appeared fabricated. 



Additionally, the CEO, Yang Jie, was also revealed to have ties to a Ponzi scheme in China. So, basically, Singularity had sold more than $21M in unregistered securities while promoting deals that didn’t exist.



As the truth surfaced, the stock collapsed more than 90%, and investors filed a lawsuit.  
  
  
Now, Singularity has agreed to a $3M settlement, and investors can already [file claims](https://11th.com/cases/singularity-investor-suit) to get payment from this agreement. 



Anyways, did anyone here hold $SGLY during its so-called “crypto transformation”?

What if Bitcoin Crashes… and Takes the U.S. Treasury Market With It?,"This is something I’ve been thinking about and haven’t seen fully discussed yet. Everyone focuses on Bitcoin price action or stablecoin FUD, but what if we’re missing a much bigger connection to the U.S. government bond market?

Let me break it down:

	•	Stablecoins like USDT and USDC are “backed” mostly by short-term U.S. Treasuries now.
	•	That means billions in U.S. government debt are sitting behind these digital tokens.
	•	As demand for stablecoins rises, these issuers buy more Treasuries. The U.S. quietly loves this. It’s new demand for debt.  

The Risk:

Now imagine a panic scenario:
	1.	Bitcoin crashes hard (regulatory move, mass sell-off, or coordinated wipeout).
	2.	People rush to redeem their stablecoins to get out of crypto.
	3.	Stablecoin issuers like Tether or Circle are forced to sell off their Treasuries fast.
	4.	If rates are high, those bonds are underwater. They sell at a loss.
	5.	If selling is widespread, this starts a fire-sale in the bond market.
	6.	That causes yields to spike, repo markets to seize, and funding costs to jump.

Sound familiar?

It should! It’s 2008 housing crisis logic, but with “risk-free” government debt at the center instead of subprime loans.

Here’s What Freaks Me Out:
	•	Treasuries are now used as derivatives, collateral, tokenized assets, and even liquidity props in crypto.
	•	They’ve become the foundation of too many leveraged trades.
	•	If enough of them hit the market at once, liquidity freezes, and contagion starts because everyone needs out at once.

Bottom Line:
	•	The crash would light the match.
	•	The explosion could land in U.S. debt markets, and that does affect the real economy.
	•	Treasuries are treated as “rock solid,” but when they’re sold through shadow pipes and leveraged layers, they become a hidden frag grenade.

I’m not saying it’ll happen tomorrow. But the scaffolding for this kind of failure is being built in plain sight.

What do you all think? Is this FUD, or are we sleepwalking into a new kind of systemic risk?

Quantum computers and the Bitcoin blockchain
An analysis of the impact quantum computers might have on the Bitcoin blockchain
One of the most well-known applications of quantum computers is breaking the mathematical difficulty underlying most of currently used cryptography. Since Google announced that it achieved quantum supremacy there has been an increasing number of articles on the web predicting the demise of currently used cryptography in general, and Bitcoin in particular. The goal of this article is to present a balanced view regarding the risks that quantum computers pose to Bitcoin.


Authors: Itan Barmes, Bram Bosch and Olaf Haalstra

The main focus of this article will be to answer the following questions:

How many Bitcoins could be stolen now if a sufficiently large quantum computer was available?
What can one do to mitigate the risk of Bitcoins being stolen by an adversary with a quantum computer?
Is the Bitcoin blockchain inherently resilient to quantum attacks now and in the future?
Quantum computers and cryptography
 

A great amount of digital ink has been spilled on the topic of how quantum computers pose an existential threat to currently used asymmetric cryptography. We will therefore not discuss this in detail, but only explain the aspects that are relevant for the analysis in this article.

In asymmetric cryptography, a private-public key pair is generated in such a manner that the two keys have a mathematical relation between them. As the name suggests, the private key is kept as secret, while the public key is made publicly available. This allows individuals to produce a digital signature (using their private key) that can be verified by anyone who has the corresponding public key. This scheme is very common in the financial industry to prove authenticity and integrity of transactions.

The security of asymmetric cryptography is based on a mathematical principle called a “one-way function”. This principle dictates that the public key can be easily derived from the private key but not the other way around. All known (classical) algorithms to derive the private key from the public key require an astronomical amount of time to perform such a computation and are therefore not practical. However, in 1994, the mathematician Peter Shor published a quantum algorithm that can break the security assumption of the most common algorithms of asymmetric cryptography. This means that anyone with a sufficiently large quantum computer could use this algorithm to derive a private key from its corresponding public key, and thus, falsify any digital signature.

Bitcoin 101
 

To understand the impact of quantum computers on Bitcoin, we will start with a brief summary about how Bitcoin transactions work. Bitcoin is a decentralized system for transferring value. Unlike the banking system where it is the responsibility of a bank to provide customers with a bank account, a Bitcoin user is responsible for generating his own (random) address. By means of a simple procedure, the user's computer calculates a random Bitcoin address (related to the public key) as well as a secret (private key) that is required in order to perform transactions from this address.

Moving Bitcoins from one address to another is called a transaction. Such a transaction is similar to sending money from one bank account to another. In Bitcoin, the sender must authorize their transaction by providing a digital signature that proves they own the address where the funds are stored. Remember: someone with an operational quantum computer who has your public key could falsify this signature, and therefore potentially spend anyone’s Bitcoins!

In the Bitcoin network, the decision of which transactions are accepted into the network is ultimately left to the so called miners. Miners compete in a race to process the next batch of transactions, also called a block. Whoever wins the race, is allowed to construct the next block, awarding them new coins as they do so. Bitcoin blocks are linked to each other in a sequential manner. Together, they form a chain of blocks, also called the “blockchain”.

The victorious miner who creates a new block, is free to include whichever transaction they wish. Other miners express their agreement by building on top of blocks they agree with. In case of a disagreement, they will build on the most recently accepted block. In other words, if a rogue miner attempts to construct an invalid block, honest miners will ignore the invalid block and build on top of the most recent valid block instead.

Address types
 

Bitcoin transactions allow for a custom logic to be implemented, enabling a myriad of financial transaction types such as escrow and shared ownership. However, for the purpose of this article, we restrict ourselves to simple person-to-person payments. These can be divided into 2 categories, each affected differently by a quantum computer.

In the first type, a public key directly serves as the Bitcoin address of the recipient. A transaction to such an address is called ‘pay to public key’ (p2pk) for obvious reasons. In the early days of Bitcoin, in 2009, this was the dominant address type. Many of the original coins mined by Satoshi Nakamoto himself are still stored in such addresses. One of the issues with these addresses is the lack of a mechanism to detect mistyping of addresses (for example a last checksum digit which is used, for example, in credit card numbers). An additional problem is that these addresses are very long, which results in a larger transaction file and therefore longer processing time. Regarding the threat from a quantum computer, the public key is directly obtainable from the address. Since all transactions in Bitcoin are public, anyone can obtain the public key from any p2pk address. A quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could then be used to derive the private key from this address. This would allow an adversary who has a quantum computer to spend the coins that the address had.

In the second type of transaction, the address of the recipient is composed of a hash of the public key. As a hash is a one-way cryptographic function, the public key is not directly revealed by the address. The first and most popular implementation of this is called ‘pay to public key hash’ (p2pkh) and was designed to solve the two issues described above (checksum and address length, for a more elaborate explanation we refer to this page. As was mentioned above, the public key cannot be retrieved from the address. The public key is only revealed at the moment when the owner wishes to initiate a transaction. This means that as long as funds have never been transferred from a p2pkh address, the public key is not known and the private key cannot be derived using a quantum computer. There is a ‘but’ though! If funds are ever transferred from a specific p2pkh address (no matter what amount), the public key is revealed. From that moment on, this address is marked ""used"" and should ideally not be used again to receive new coins. In fact, many wallets are programmed to avoid address reuse as best they can. Avoiding the reuse of addresses is considered best practice for Bitcoin users, but you would be surprised how many people do not take this advice to heart. More on that in the following chapter.

How many Bitcoins could be stolen now if sufficiently large quantum computers were available?
 

Imagine that someone manages to build a quantum computer today and is therefore able to derive private keys. How many Bitcoins will be in danger?

To answer this question, we analyzed the entire Bitcoin blockchain to identify which coins are vulnerable to an attack from a quantum computer. As explained in the previous section, all coins in p2pk addresses and reused p2pkh addresses are vulnerable to a quantum attack. The result of our analysis is presented in the figure below. It shows the distribution of Bitcoins in the various address types over time. As can clearly be seen in the graph, p2pk addresses dominated the Bitcoin blockchain in the first year of its existence. Interestingly, the number of coins in p2pk addresses has stayed practically constant (circa 2M Bitcoins). A reasonable assumption is that these coins were generated through mining and have never been moved from their original address.

As p2pkh was introduced 2010, it quickly became dominant. Most of the coins created since then are stored in this type of address. In the graph we see that the number of Bitcoins stored in reused p2pkh increases from 2010 to 2014, and since then is decreasing slowly to reach the current amount of 2.5M Bitcoins. This suggests that people are generally following the best practice of not using p2pk address as well as not reusing p2pkh addresses. Nevertheless, there are still over 4 million BTC (about 25% of all Bitcoins) which are potentially vulnerable to a quantum attack. At the current price this is over 40 billion USD!


What can one do to mitigate the risk of Bitcoins being stolen by an adversary with a quantum computer?
 

In the previous section we explained that p2pk and reused p2pkh addresses are vulnerable to quantum attacks. However, p2pkh addresses that have never been used to spend Bitcoins are safe, as their public keys are not yet public. This means that if you transfer your Bitcoins to a new p2pkh address, then they should not be vulnerable to a quantum attack.

The issue with this approach is that many owners of vulnerable Bitcoins have lost their private keys. These coins cannot be transferred and are waiting to be taken by the first person who manages to build a sufficiently large quantum computer. A way to address this issue is to come to a consensus within the Bitcoin community and provide an ultimatum for people to move their coins to a safe address. After a predefined period, coins in unsafe addresses would become unusable (technically, this means that miner will ignore transactions coming from these addresses). Such a drastic step needs to be considered carefully before implemented, not to mention the complexity of achieving consensus about such a sensitive issue.

Is the Bitcoin blockchain inherently resilient to quantum attacks now and in the future?
 

Let’s assume for a minute that all owners of vulnerable Bitcoins transfer their funds to safe addresses (everyone who lost their private key ‘magically’ finds them). Does that mean that the Bitcoin blockchain is no longer vulnerable to quantum attacks? The answer to this question is actually not that simple. The prerequisite of being “quantum safe” is that the public key associated with this address is not public. But as we explained above, the moment you want to transfer coins from such a “safe” address, you also reveal the public key, making the address vulnerable. From that moment until your transaction is “mined”, an attacker who possesses a quantum computer gets a window of opportunity to steal your coins. In such an attack, the adversary will first derive your private key from the public key and then initiate a competing transaction to their own address. They will try to get priority over the original transaction by offering a higher mining fee.

In the Bitcoin blockchain it currently takes about 10 minutes for transactions to be mined (unless the network is congested which has happened frequently in the past). As long as it takes a quantum computer longer to derive the private key of a specific public key then the network should be safe against a quantum attack. Current scientific estimations predict that a quantum computer will take about 8 hours to break an RSA key, and some specific calculations predict that a Bitcoin signature could be hacked within 30 minutes. This means that Bitcoin should be, in principle, resistant to quantum attacks (as long as you do not reuse addresses). However, as the field of quantum computers is still in its infancy, it is unclear how fast such a quantum computer will become in the future. If a quantum computer will ever get closer to the 10 minutes mark to derive a private key from its public key, then the Bitcoin blockchain will be inherently broken.

Closing remarks
 

Quantum computers are posing a serious challenge to the security of the Bitcoin blockchain. Presently, about 25% of the Bitcoins in circulation are vulnerable to a quantum attack. If you have Bitcoins in a vulnerable address and believe that progress in quantum computing is more advanced than publicly known, then you should probably transfer your coins to a new p2pkh address (don’t forget to make a secure backup of your private key).

In case your own Bitcoins are safe in a new p2pkh address, you might still be impacted if many people will not (or cannot) take the same protection measures. In a situation where a large number of Bitcoins is stolen, the price will most likely crash and the confidence in the technology will be lost.

Even if everyone takes the same protection measures, quantum computers might eventually become so fast that they will undermine the Bitcoin transaction process. In this case the security of the Bitcoin blockchain will be fundamentally broken. The only solution in this case is to transition to a new type of cryptography called ‘post-quantum cryptography’, which is considered to be inherently resistant to quantum attacks. These types of algorithms present other challenges to the usability of blockchains and are being investigated by cryptographers around the world. We anticipate that future research into post-quantum cryptography will eventually bring the necessary change to build robust and future-proof blockchain applications.",False,0.0

How is bitcoin performing compared to other blockchains in 2025?,"Bitcoin continues to hold its dominance in the market, but with more competition from fast-growing networks like Solana, it’s interesting to watch how things are evolving. Bitcoin has been pretty stable around the $30k–$35k range, and while it's not seeing the explosive growth it had during the bull runs, the institutional interest continues to grow, which could lead to long-term stability.

"twenty one capital quietly accumulated 43,500 btc, more supply getting locked away from retail","just saw this bloomberg report about twenty one capital and honestly this is way bigger than people are talking about. they launched in april saying they'd accumulate bitcoin, but turns out they've been way more aggressive than anyone realized.

they now hold 43,500 btc (worth around $5.1 billion), which is 1,500 more than they originally projected. tether just dumped another 5,800 btc into their treasury on top of the 37,229 btc they got back in june

here's what's actually happening: we're watching the final stages of bitcoin's transition from retail speculation to institutional reserve asset. twenty one capital is backed by cantor fitzgerald, softbank, tether, and bitfinex, these aren't crypto bros making leveraged bets. they're building permanent bitcoin treasuries.

the supply math is getting brutal for anyone trying to accumulate:

microstrategy: 607,000 btc

mara holdings: 50,000 btc

twenty one capital: 43,500 btc (and growing)

riot, cleanspark, hut 8: thousands more each

that's over 700,000 btc locked in corporate treasuries that basically never gets sold. with only 21 million btc total and probably 4-5 million lost forever, we're looking at maybe 15 million actually circulating. these institutions are hoovering up 5% of the entire supply.

what makes twenty one different is they're not using debt like saylor. they raised cash from backers and bought spot btc directly. no liquidation risk, no forced selling during crashes. pure diamond hands backed by billions in traditional finance money.

jack mallers (strike ceo) is running this thing and they're going public through a spac merger. once that happens, pension funds and index funds will start buying their stock, which gives them more capital to buy more btc. it's a feedback loop that keeps removing supply.

the writing is on the wall retail is getting priced out of meaningful btc accumulation. when companies can casually drop $5 billion on btc without breaking a sweat, your $100 weekly dca isn't moving the needle anymore.

this isn't even including the etfs pulling in billions every week. blackrock's etf alone holds over $40 billion in btc.

we're in the final phase where institutions are quietly absorbing all available supply while retail still thinks this is about trading and technical analysis. by the time normies wake up to what's happening, obtaining whole bitcoins will be completely out of reach for regular people.

twenty one capital adding 1,500 more btc than planned should be headline news. that's $180 million worth of supply that just vanished from circulation forever. multiply this across dozens of other institutions doing the same thing and you realize the supply shock hasn't even started yet. Good thing services like awaken.tax exist because tracking all these institutional moves for tax implications is getting complex as hell.

They are getting institutional money that would otherwise be going to bitcoin, but can't. Strategy is providing stocks and bonds that are proxies for Bitcoin.

In 2012, something called pay-to-hash [created a way](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0016) where anyone could send money to a program, without revealing the contents of the program or how the money could be spent before hand. 

In 2022, a continuation of the original bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash upgraded to enable programs to refer to the input and output amounts when spending money from these programs. So it became possible to fund an irrevocable trust, Rockefeller-style, that pays 1% of the running balance of a fund every month, allowing anyone to call the program that pays some party without that party having to do anything. 

***

There is an app called unspent.cash, which lets anyone calculate the p2sh address for a monthly irrevocable trust. It also has a feature to ""announce"" the contract, so it's recorded and someone will execute it automatically every month. 

So if you have some funds now, and you decided an irrevocable trust is right for you, you can fund the trust but NOT announce it. 

You could write down the seed phrase for the address the funds are going to, and write down that there is a standard v2 perpetuity pointed at the first address for that seed. That information will allow your heirs to announce the contract in the future. 

There is more information here:

https://unspent.cash/help 

https://unspent.cash/bitcoin.jpg

We’re building a BCH-powered transport service in Mozambique — and people are already asking when they can ride.,"I never thought I'd say this, but here I am trying to launch a transport business that accepts Bitcoin Cash on the streets of Maputo and Matola, Mozambique.

We call it CHAPA BCH Moçambique. It's not just another crypto experiment - it's a real, boots-on-the-ground project to put BCH where it matters: in the hands of riders and drivers who need better options.

Here’s the reality:

People here pay a lot for transport using outdated, centralized systems.

Many are already familiar with mobile money - and more than you think are using crypto (especially USDT, BTC, and BCH via exchanges and Forex groups).

But there’s no one showing them how crypto can be used for everyday life - like getting to work, school, or the market.


So I decided to be that person.

We’ve already raised 9.25 BCH out of 17 - enough to feel the traction, but not enough to hit the streets just yet. The plan? Buy low-cylinder cars and txopelas (like tuk-tuks), wrap them in BCH branding, train local drivers to accept crypto via Paytaca POS, and help riders pay using mobile or BCH - all instantly swapped into BCH under the hood.

No VC. No giant team. Just me, some drivers, and a lot of hope that we can make this work from the ground up.

 Here's the campaign if you want to check it out or support: 💚 https://fundme.cash/campaign/54

Noel Lovisa Appeals Bitcoin Cash City Trademark Opposition Loss to the Federal Court of Australia,"On July 3rd 2025, the Registrar of Trademarks ruled against [Noel Lovisa, CEO of Code Valley](https://bitcoincashcity.com/noel-lovisa-launches-opposition-to-bitcoin-cash-city-trademark-application/), in his latest attempt to hijack my intellectual property by opposing my **Bitcoin Cash City** trademark. Despite submitting over 1,000 pages of ""evidence"", and hiring a barrister to supplement his team of solicitors, **he lost on every single ground**. For context, I defended this matter with a single solicitor and responded to the opposition in 150 pages - which was enough to secure a victory in which Lovisa was ordered to pay my costs.  
  
You’d think after being [defeated at the World Intellectual Property Organization](https://bitcoincashcity.com/bitcoincashcity-com-udrp-complaint-decision-summary/) (WIPO) and [now at the Australian Trademarks Office](https://bitcoincashcity.com/bitcoin-cash-city-trade-mark-decision-summary/), both cases he initiated against me, he’d finally get the message. Instead, he’s doubling down again, appealing the decision to the Federal Court of Australia like a compulsive gambler who can’t stop chasing losses. The hole he’s digging keeps getting deeper, as does the legal bill for both of us - though Lovisa has undoubtedly burned through far more cash than I have.

After he first began threatening me with his lawyer in December 2021, [I offered](https://x.com/BitcoinCashCity/status/1594902903826759681?ref=bitcoincashcity.com) to transfer all Bitcoin Cash City assets and even my personal YouTube channel to him **for free** \- on the simple condition that he leave me alone. He arrogantly rejected this one-sided offer, convinced he held some kind of leverage over me. I made further attempts to settle, including after his failed [WIPO UDRP complaint](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/case.jsp?case_id=60486&ref=bitcoincashcity.com) and before the trademark proceedings began. These, too, were flatly rejected and I only received new legal threats in response.

Due to this unreasonable behaviour, I am left with no choice but to continue defending my rights in Bitcoin Cash City. I'm fully confident that the Federal Court will uphold the ruling of the Trademarks Office, making it three for three in cases Lovisa has brought, and lost, against me. I especially look forward to cross-examining him in court, where he won’t be able to hide behind his lawyers, and it will make for excellent content. Once this minor inconvenience is dealt with, I’ll reserve my rights to pursue any action necessary to halt ongoing trademark infringements and seek compensation for the damages caused by Noel Lovisa and his companies over these last few years.",False,8.0

btc grinding toward $120k but analysts are warning about massive volatility spikes incoming...crucial days ahead,"just watching btc claw its way back from $114.5k and honestly, the setup for some wild price action is looking pretty intense right now. we're sitting at $117k and the charts are screaming that things are about to get way more violent.

so here's what's got me paying attention: we're literally sandwiched between two massive liquidation clusters. there's $1.1 billion in shorts that get wiped if we push past $120k, but there's also a huge liquidity zone down at $113.8k that could suck us back down.

the gamma exposure stuff is what's really interesting though. dealers are heavily short gamma right now, which basically means they're gonna have to hedge aggressively when price starts moving. that creates this feedback loop where small moves turn into massive swings.

one analyst straight up said ""expect potentially larger price swings in the near term"" and when you look at the order book data, it makes total sense. the liquidity is super thin in both directions around these key levels.

we bounced hard off that $114.5k low and managed to close back above the 10-day moving average, but multiple traders are saying we need to clear $119.5k to really get this thing moving. if we can't break that level, we're probably just gonna keep chopping around in this range.

the us-china tariff delay news helped push us higher today, but that feels more like a temporary relief than anything fundamental. what's really driving this is the positioning and liquidity dynamics.

here's what i'm watching: if we push toward $121k, those short liquidations could create a violent spike toward the old highs around $123k. but if we fail here and start sliding, that $113.8k magnet could pull us down fast with long liquidations adding fuel to the drop. if we do get one of these violent moves, gonna be a lot of people scrambling to figure out their tax situation. been using awaken.tax to track all my trades since this volatility makes it impossible to calculate gains manually. definitely recommend getting your records sorted before we hit peak madness.

either way, the next few days could be absolutely wild. the price action feels coiled up and ready to explode in either direction. anybody else seeing this setup or am i reading too much into it?",False,0.0

"Bitwise CIO just destroyed the Bitcoin 4-year cycle theory, says 2026 will be massive","Just heard something that completely changed how I'm thinking about Bitcoin's future. Matt Hougan from Bitwise (the guys managing billions in crypto) just came out and said the famous 4-year halving cycle is basically dead. And his reasoning actually makes sense.

Hougan's argument is pretty straightforward - each halving becomes ""half as important"" as the last one. The supply shock gets smaller every time, so the price impact should be less dramatic. But more importantly, he thinks bigger forces are now driving Bitcoin that have nothing to do with halving schedules.
Interest rates are the big one. Trump's been pushing Powell to cut rates, and when that happens, boring investments like bonds become less attractive. Money flows into assets like Bitcoin instead.

Then there's regulation. Hougan says the ""blow-up risk"" for Bitcoin is way lower now because we're getting clearer rules and institutional adoption is happening. Companies aren't as scared to jump in anymore.

He's specifically betting that 2026 will be an ""up year"" for Bitcoin. According to the old cycle, 2026 should be a down year - part of the bear market phase. But he thinks institutional adoption and regulatory clarity will override the traditional pattern.

The CryptoQuant CEO apparently said the same thing recently. His take was that the old ""whales sell to retail"" pattern is dead because now it's ""old whales selling to new long-term whales."" Institutional money changes everything.
Of course, with all these potential gains, tax planning becomes crucial. Tools like awaken.tax are becoming more important as investors need to track their crypto holdings across multiple cycles and regulatory changes.

Bitcoin treasury companies. These are firms that keep issuing stock or taking on debt to buy more Bitcoin. If Bitcoin crashes hard, some of these companies could get seriously hurt, which could create a feedback loop.
I've been following the 4-year cycle religiously, but this argument is making me reconsider. If institutions are really driving demand now instead of retail FOMO cycles, then maybe we're in a completely different game.
Hougan thinks we're looking at a ""sustained steady boom"" rather than the crazy pumps and dumps we used to see. That actually sounds more sustainable long-term.
Some analysts like Rekt Capital still think we'll peak around October 2025, following the traditional timeline. So there's definitely disagreement here.

Because I've never believed in any cycle. Bitcoin's rate of supply has been known since the very beginning. The supply squeeze is an invention of stupid human psyche. The price should be baked in already that there are 21M total BTC (obviously less because some must be forever lost).

Do you believe the trend of people adopting / subscribing to bitcoin's original purpose every year is going up or down? That's all that matters. Even in down years, adoption trend goes up, it's just there's more useless speculators in the market those years.

"Bitwise CIO just destroyed the Bitcoin 4-year cycle theory, says 2026 will be massive","A fixed supply compounded by lack of liquidity (small blocks) creates the wild swings.

Because it's a closed-system with a fixed supply, all other factors become amplified, namely social factors. And because price is the only quantifiable output users can grasp, it makes a very tight feedback loop. This makes Bitcoin a pure, textbook example of how speculation and FOMO are price drivers.

And no amount of institutional hoarding can quell it because ultimately they're steered by committee and that committee dictates the stop-limits. And when the stop-limits happen to align with enough peers in high finance, the needle moves to extremes up and down. **And in Bitcoin there are no ""curbs"" activated on programmed trading.**

This is a hard feedback loop. It's like that hideously loud, high-pitch shrill when a hot microphone is placed too close to a loudspeaker.

i'll buy back more when i can afford to. but here's what i keep thinking about, what's the point of accumulating btc until you die and never actually enjoy the profits? until you use your bitcoin, it's just numbers on a screen.

my employees needed their pay. that's real. that matters right now. bitcoin will still be there when i have extra money to put back in.

i think we get so caught up in always wanting more that we forget why we're doing this in the first place. there's more to life than just accumulating and never spending. sometimes you have to use your investments for what actually matters.

"sold some of my btc yesterday to make payroll, and i'm actually fine with it","You’re right and noticed one of the key problems with crypto “investing” is that its completely taken over by dogma (rigid belief systems) such as “bitcoin has no where to go but up” and “you are better off holding bitcoin than selling it.” This dogma is layered over every instance and interaction within that system. Dogma is something that is completely toxic and antithetical to any successful investing strategy because it promotes resorting to basic behavioral “rules” instead of critically thinking about your strategy for what it is in that exact moment in time. The more rigid a dogmatic system is the greater chance that on a long enough timeframe you will eventually miss the writing on the wall and your strategy will fail. In bitcoin and crypto in general this is especially rampant because now that the space is dominated with big players that have concentrated wealth into the hands of a few and crypto lacks the fundamentals that stocks, bonds or pretty much every other investment has in order for it to perpetually increase the only way for value to increase in the system is for there to be a positive flow of money into the system. If someone sells that represents a flow of money out of the system which puts downward pressure on the price (although you as the seller stand to gain something from your sale).

Julian dropped the biggest truth bomb ever with smart dust. Over a decade ago. 


Once everyone finds out this is basically all around us on a nano type scale then they will understand. 
He understood Bitcoin had to be pushed have a chance at pulling back some control from the Cannaba'als. 
He failed at the time. And he's lucky to be alive. 
He refused to give up his phrase. He's a way stronger man than almost all understand. He's flawed like all of us of course though. 
But once you understand what Mendax means and to Julian it all starts making sense.

Early Bitcoin whales losing faith and selling,"Scott Melker says many early Bitcoin whales are losing confidence and selling because the asset is getting co opted by the exact institutions it was meant to hedge against.

What Melker's pointing out isn't necessarily wrong though. When BlackRock and JPMorgan start accumulating massive Bitcoin positions, does that fundamentally change what Bitcoin represents…. The original cypherpunk vision was about financial sovereignty outside traditional systems. Now those same systems are becoming the primary drivers of adoption and price discovery.

Mike Alfred pushes back saying people sell for personal reasons unrelated to the protocol itself, which is fair. But I think he's missing the deeper psychological point here. When your hedge against institutional control  becomes institutionally controlled, that creates confusion for early adopters who bought into the revolutionary narrative.

Bitcoin doesn't discriminate, it's for everyone including non believers and governments. That's mathematically true but emotionally complicated for people who saw Bitcoin as resistance against those exact entities.

Bitcoin is still the first global money backed by logic rather than state violence. The protocol itself hasn't changed, just the participant base. But does widespread institutional adoption dilute the revolutionary potential or validate it….

What I find particularly telling is how this philosophical tension shows up in practical ways when early adopters are managing their holdings through tax compliance platforms like awaken.tax or other plateforms, they're interfacing with the very regulatory frameworks they originally sought to escape, creating a daily reminder of how Bitcoin has become integrated into traditional financial infrastructure

If you look at the manifesto, in phase II you will see involves a decentralized compute network overlayed with a privacy focused crypto-currency.

Initially I was thinking of developing my own crypto-currency.  Monero is great, but I don't like the technical implementation with the multiple daemons -- wallet, server node, clinet, etc.  Definitely not doing Ethereum, as I hate that protocol.

Have been developing bitcoin related systems since 2010 though, so know the protocol inside out.  Even developed my own node once.  Haven't kept up with all the latest BIPs, but the base protocol remains the same.

To save time and energy, almost thinking instead of developing my own crypto currency, might be best to just use bitcoin instead.  What do you think?

P2P - what’s the issue?,"One of the most common issues this sub has with BTC is that it’s “not the p2p system in the white paper.”

",False,12.0
P2P - what’s the issue?,"Yes, if you are a just casually using BTC it might seem like it works like a p2p cash system.

So here are some numbers to make it clear.

BTCs blocksize is limited to 1MB. Bitcoiners fought a war over this limit and the ones who wanted the limit to stay won the ticker. 

Now, why will this become a problem. A 1 MB block can process roughly 2500 tx or 300000 tx per day. As long as there aren't much more transaction that needs processing this is fine. But once there are lets say 400000 tx per day the transactions pile up and people try to outpay each other in fees to get into the next block. The top 300000 payers get their tx into a block on this day. We have seen fee spikes like that already and we have witnessed how transactions reliability breaks down. People waited for days for a confirmation or never got their tx mined at all. Fees spiked to $50 or even $100.

Now to put this all into perspective. 300000 tx per day means only 0.01% of the population can make a daily transactions. Or the top 1% can make a transaction every 100 days. To get half the population onto LN would take 30 ~ 60 years, no other traffic allowed.

Bitcoin down from recent highs,"Bitcoin dropping looks like coordinated distribution from a major whale holding 80,009 BTC (worth about $9.6 billion).

This whale has been systematically moving Bitcoin since July 15th. First, 9,000 BTC ($1.06 billion) went to Galaxy, followed by 7,843 BTC ($927 million)  that's 16,843 BTC ($2 billion) moved in a single day. Galaxy immediately started routing portions to Binance and Bybit.

What I think might be happening is positioning ahead of known policy events. The Fed meeting is on July 30th, and the White House crypto policy report drops the exact same day. This report is supposed to detail how much seized Bitcoin the government holds and their management strategy.

If you're holding that much Bitcoin and suspect the Treasury might announce systematic selling of government reserves, or new regulatory frameworks that could suppress institutional adoption temporarily, you'd want to exit ahead of that announcement. they're using proper liquidity channels instead of dumping on spot markets.

 Other dormant wallets are suddenly active after years of silence. A 14.5-year-old wallet containing $468 million worth of Bitcoin just awakened. When multiple early holders coordinate movements like this, they typically have information the market hasn't processed yet.

Market absorption has been surprisingly strong though. $3.5 billion hit exchanges in the last 24 hours and we only saw a 3% drop. Either there's significant buying pressure at these levels, or this distribution phase isn't complete.The measured response indicates institutional buyers may be absorbing whale selling, potentially through platforms like awaken.tax and similar professional trading venues that facilitate large block transactions without creating excessive volatility.

The timing is around July 30th. exiting ahead of policy uncertainty, to avoid volatility around regulatory announcements. This could be temporary positioning before re entering once the landscape clarifies which could give us a bull run again. ",False,10.0

Autentika,"Hello!

A few days ago I launched **Autentika**, a web platform where in just a few steps you can certify and verify any document on the Bitcoin network for a fixed price. Once it’s on chain, it stays there forever.

**How it works**

* Upload your document (PDF, image, or ZIP) and its SHA-256 hash is calculated automatically.
* That hash is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain using an OP\_RETURN field.
* You receive a link and a QR code so anyone can instantly confirm your file’s authenticity.
* All verifications are public and free—no subscriptions or hidden fees.

**Use cases**

* **Academic diplomas and certificates:** issue digital diplomas with irrefutable proof.
* **Contracts and agreements:** validate the exact version without exposing the content.
* **Intellectual property:** register sketches, scripts, or inventions with an immutable timestamp.
* **Electronic evidence for legal processes:** certify screenshots, emails, or chat logs.

**How to get started**

1. Go to [https://www.autentika.app](https://www.autentika.app)
2. Open the **Operations** tab and upload your document.
3. If it’s already certified, you’ll see the result instantly. If not, click **Certify** to get a new hash recorded on chain.

* What do you think of the price?
* Can you think of any other use cases?
* Any feedback on the user experience?

Here’s what my current split looks like:

* Core BTC sits on a hardware wallet with a seed I could memorise if I really had to. No staking, no lending, just cold storage and the odd Sparrow sweep.
* Day-to-day spending (coffees, train tickets) lives on BlueWallet / Muun with small, refill-only balances.

- destroyed by fire or water

- Protect you from losing your wallet in case your primary hard wallet device fails
- Protect you from losing your wallet in case of a major disaster such as if your home burns down
- Protect you from losing your wallet in case your memory fails you and you cannot remember the pin/password.
- Provide a path to recovery for your next in kind should something happen to you

Are we celebrating Bitcoin's defeat while calling it victory?,"Saw an interesting discussion about Max Keiser's warning on government seizures and it got me thinking about something that's been bothering me.

Everyone gets excited when big institutions buy Bitcoin, but isn't this exactly what we didn't want? The whole point was to create an alternative to traditional finance, not hand control over to the same players we were trying to escape.

Here's what's happening: Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized, but we're watching it get concentrated into fewer and fewer hands. The mining centralization ship has mostly sailed, and now we're seeing supply centralization too. When BlackRock and other massive institutions hold huge amounts of Bitcoin, they essentially control it for regular people who buy their ETFs.

Some people say both things can be true - Bitcoin can remain self-custodial AND institutions can adopt it. But here's my question: if most people are buying Bitcoin through institutions instead of holding their own keys, are we really winning?

It feels like we're so focused on number go up that we've forgotten why Bitcoin existed in the first place. Getting people out of the traditional financial system was supposed to be the goal, not bringing that system into Bitcoin.

The institutions didn't join us we joined them. They're not adopting Bitcoin's values, they're making Bitcoin adopt their methods.

Maybe I'm being too negative, but when I see people celebrating institutional adoption while those same institutions offer zero education about self-custody, it makes me wonder if we've lost the plot. Even services like awaken.tax that help people manage their crypto taxes are seeing more institutional clients than individual self-custody users these days.

What do you think? Can Bitcoin maintain its original purpose while being dominated by traditional finance? Or are we just watching a slow-motion takeover while convincing ourselves it's adoption?",False,49.0

"Guide for Newcomers: Don't Fall into ""Ref-Code"" Spammers.","Hi guys, this post is for newcomers basically, but it you don't really know about tradings, you can also enter here.

Today I'm going to talk about the Ref Codes: What is it, why are the spammers are on site, what should we do?

***(Not posting any any kind of codes here, no promotion, no advertising).***

Let's go on with the questions.

# Do you know what is Ref code?

Many of you know, but for beginners they might not know. Ref codes are the codes that you can put in when you regiester to each exchanges like binance, coinbase, kraken.

# Why do we use Ref codes?

It depends on exchanges, if you register with a ref codes, you can get some benefits like a small amount of USDT Fee coupon or something like that. (about 20 USDT is the most common thing I think

# The Real Problem is: What does the ""Code Owners"" get?

Have you guys ever thought about it? Especially newcomers, do you actually thought about this ?

Here's the thing. Why are they spamming the ref codes all over the communities? What makes them to do it? They do it because they get huge amount of money, that you cannot even imagine.

***They takes 20\~85% of your whole trading fee.***

You might not feel how much you are losing to these leakage.

|Balance|$2,000|
|:-|:-|
|Leverages|20x|
|Weekly Position|15|
|Exchange, Order|Binance, Taker 100%|
|**Fees Paid**|**$2,400/month**|
|**Code Owners Get**|**$480\~$1200/month**|

This is how influencers, affiliation partners that provides you a code, living life. You are funding their lifestyle. Not Trading or any other real effort activities are making their money.

# Then, what should we do?

1. The best way you can do is, using a friend's code, the IRL friend's code and then give your code to them. Both do a trade and give each others' commission back to each other.
   1. This can make your fee leaking simply stop. But, it is kinda hassle to talk to friend every friday of last month, to give my money.
2. The second way is using your family's one. It is way more simple, but I think there will be not much ppl that wants to go family and ask to do those actions.
3. The last one is using a third party tools that makes these self-referral process automatically. (But this is not a mandatory. No promoting, No Advertising, Nothing.)
4. They works like this :
   1. You register with ""A""'s ref-code.
   2. You receive one-time 20USDT coupon
   3. ""A"" gets the 20\~80% of your trading fee, permanently.
   4. Third Party Tools stands on the seat of ""A"", and they gives it back to users, and take the small leftover amounts and exchange official event benefits.

# The end:

Thanks for reading this long post, and have a nice trade today guys. Good luck!

If you got any questions, I'm always open, so comment right away !

  
P.S. ***I will not talk about the exact names of the tools because I think that might be accused as promoting those ones.*** Also, these services offer different payback rates (50\~70%) so you should do some research to find best one fitting to  you. ***You can find it out easily I think. So do your search I recommend.*** I know at least 2 of them, and both offers different rates for same exchange.

Living Off Bitcoin Experiment. Update one.,"About a month ago I posted about trying to live off Bitcoin. Most comments called it dumb or said it wouldn’t work due to taxes and fees. I actually agreed, but I’ve found a simple solution that works for me. It’s not perfect, but here’s my plan to start. I will learn as I go and get better I am sure.

The Plan:  
I’m using Strike’s Direct Deposit, Pay Rent, and Pay Bills features. 100% of my paychecks will be converted to Bitcoin on Strike. For expenses, I’ll use credit cards with solid rewards (for example Gemini’s 4% Bitcoin cashback or Prime/Chase for Amazon purchases). So in short I am spending USD that are not mine, and instead of paying off my cards every paycheck like I have been doing my whole life, I'll simply do one payment monthly via Strike’s Pay Bills feature to minimize Bitcoin transfer fees. It won’t eliminate fees entirely but lower them quit a bit, and I’m fine with that. Once I hit a certain amount of Bitcoin on Strike I’ll move my Bitcoin to a cold wallet.

Having 12 payments a year(one a month) via Strike paying off cards, I can use their tax forms to easily fill out taxes. As for income/capital tax, it shouldn't be much but even so it just means Bitcoin went up and I am beating inflation.

Savings:  
I’m converting half my savings to Bitcoin now and the other half over the next 3 months. If this doesn’t work out, I can easily switch my direct deposit back to my bank and convert savings back to USD.

Why I’m Doing This:  
With Bitcoin hovering around $117-120k, I don’t see it disappearing, and frankly it’s got too much momentum. I’m fed up with my hard earned money losing value and my investments barely outpacing inflation. I’m going 100% into Bitcoin over the next few months. I’ll either sink with the ship or sail to the new world! (lol that was so cheesy).

I wouldn't normally share this info but I have been seeing more interest in doing this exact thing from a lot of people online, some friends, and some family. I hope my journey can help others who are interested and seeing what works and doesn't.

As always I love the discussion and feedback. What do you think? Any tips or flaws I’m missing?

How will miners/transporters be paid when no more BTC can be created?,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but: 

The rate at which BTC can be produced, a mining, gets halved every few years.

Either halving will keep happening until no one can be rewarded, or the supply runs out because all the BTC will be mined.

When this happens, how will BTC be move-able if no one will move it without getting a mining reward from the blockchain? In order for BTC to be transmitted, it requires someone to still be mining BTC, right?

Mozambique’s economy is driven by the informal sector - and transport (chapas and txopelas) plays a central role. With CHAPA BCH, people will:

•Pay for rides in BCH

•See BCH branding on the streets daily

•Use decentralized money for real-world services

•Open new earning opportunities for drivers

I try to shed some light on that. To analyze trends and respect the halving, I calculated trend values such as:

* The annualized four-year logarithmic return of BTC. As of 1 July 2023, I obtained 28.26%.
* The annualized four-year volatility of BTC. As of 1 July 2023, I obtained 54.48%.

To estimate the probabililty that a current investment in BTC will multiply by 10 or more in 5 years, I need the current value of logarithmic return (i.e. the logarithmic return of BTC as of 26 July 2025). So, how can I obtain it? One possibility is to use the same value of 28.26% as of 1 July 2023. Note that this value is rather an overestimate, since the plot of logarithmic return of BTC shows a decreasing trend. Therefore, using the value of 28.26%, we will be more optimistic than realistic. A realistic return estimate of BTC as of 26 July 2025 should be smaller than that.

To estimate the current value of volatility of BTC, we again need an estimate of it as of 26 July 2025. If we use the value of 54.48%, we will again overestimate the current volatility of BTC, since the volatility plot of BTC shows a decreasing trend.

Now, the probability that a current investment in BTC will multiply by less than 10 in 5 years can be estimated using a formula

`=NORM.DIST(LN(10);5*0,2826;SQRT(5)*0,5448;1)`

This formula used, e.g. in LibreOffice Calc yields the value of 76.74%, estimating that the probability that a current investment in BTC will grow to less than its 10 times multiple is about 76.74%. The probability that it will grow 10 times or more is thus only about 23.26%, i.e. less than one fourth.

Also note that:

* We overestimated both the current return as well as current volatility of BTC, actually overestimating the probability of success.
* The calculation is an extrapolation of the historical trends to the future, so the results may well be worse even if we did not overestimate the values.
* We disregarded fees, which is also overly optimistic.",True,1.0

CashCraft - BCH Minecraft server?,"Hi everyone.

I’ve been playing Minecraft for a long time. I’ve always wanted to create my own server, but only recently have I had an idea that might set it apart from the others.

I’d like to create a server where the standard game currency is BCH. Users can then deposit and withdraw BCH, allowing them to earn as they play by trading items, maybe competing in minigames etc.

This might seem like a niche that would only attract a small number of players, but I want the server to be normal and fun even for those who don’t know that BCH is being used as currency. So it will function like any other server, and be playable without depositing BCH.

I’m looking to assemble a team who can handle the different aspects of this project, from server development (java) to everything that needs to be working in the background.

I’m 100% open to suggestions about what tools could be useful for this project. My DMs are open and if you want to be a member of this project, we could make an arrangement and you would be invited to a Discord server.

"For begineers, from 6 years of experience, i beg you to read this before you buy your first Bitcoin. I will explain the fee trap every newcomer falls into (it might cost you 17% every trade)","Hello everyone, I believe currently a lot of newcomers are joining this subreddit, and especially for bitcoin & ETH.

I'm Henry, and I've traded 6 years on cryptocurrency market. I was mainly a spot trader for my first year, and for the 5 years, I mainly played on futures market. Today we are going to talk about the beginners' frustrations.

Every beginners, including me, will get into this feeling:***""I want to buy bitcoin, but how can I buy it? and where can I buy it ?""***

And the most easily found option for you will high likely to be ""Coinbase"" or ""Robinhood"". I've actually seen a lot people using these apps to buy a Bitcoin.

The simple and clear conclusion for this situation is, NEVER BUY ON THESE PLATFORMS

You might say, ""it is just a fee, how much it would charge me? it will def not cost that much"".

You are wrong. It can charge you ***up to 15% per each trade,*** and even it is the cheapest one on the above, you will get charged ***24 Times higher fees*** than alternatives.

On this post, I'll break down the fee structure of those options above, and then give you the optimized solutions.

# Coinbase (Basic Mode)

First lets talk about coinbase. I think all the intermediate users will know, the fee structure of coinbase is chaos itself, and booby trap for beginners.

This is because...  
***- Multiple Fee Layers:*** Coinbase has payment method fees, and transaction fees. And they are OVERLAPPED.

***- Spreads:*** They includes the Spreads to Coinbase Basic users' transaction, which users cannot know the exact amount of spreads before the transaction completed.

\- ***Multiple Modes:*** Coinbase has ""Basic"" and ""Advanced"" mode. You might think some interfaces and trading features might be the only difference, but surprisingly, two modes have different fee charge system. And the more amazing part is, it charges up to 10X more higher fees to basic users.

Now let's deeply dive into the Coinbase Basics' Fee structure. Below is the **Payment method Fee table.**

|Currency|Payment Method|Fee|Explanation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ALL|Credit/Debit Card|\~3.99%|Directly Buying Bitcoin with your Card.|
|USD|Bank Account/USD WAllet|\~1.49%|Same, but with the bank account|
|USD|Wire Transfers|$10 incoming, $25 outgoing|Wire Transfer is one method of Bank Transfers|
|USD|ACH|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|USD|Wire|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|USD|SWIFT (UAE, HK, NZ, PH, KR, TW)|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|USD|FedWire|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|USD|CUBIX|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|EUR|SEPA|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|EUR|iDeal|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|EUR, GBP|Easy Bank Transfer|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|GBP|Faster Payments|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|CAD|Interac e-transfer|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|CAD|EFT bank transfer|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|BRL|Pix/Bank transfer|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|ARS|Bank Transfer|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|AUD|PayID, BSB|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|SGD|FAST SGD Account|N/A|Bank Transfer|
|SGD|USD Bank Account SWIFT|$25 + additional fee|Bank Transfer|
|USD|PayPal|2.5% estimated|USA only, unclear documentation|
|Netherlands, Italy, Spain, UK|3D Secure Card|N/A|Confusing fee structure|

*Disclaimer: For the N/A options, I could not find any of official documents of Coinbase Help Center. They only documented the method of payments, not about the fees. Unless you try to do the process by your app, it does not shows you the actual fees. But I am Korean so I'm not even available to try one of those options. In case, I cannot find out the fee structure of these options.*

And the below table is ***Transaction Fee Table***

|Transaction Amount|Fee Amount|Percentage|
|:-|:-|:-|
|<$10|$0.99 + Spread|at least 1% + a|
|$10-$25|$1.49 + Spread|5.96% - 15% + a|
|$25-$50|$1.99 + Spread|3.98% - 7.96% + a|
|$50-$200|$2.99 + Spread|1.49% - 5.98% + a|
|\>$200|0.5% Spread|N/A I cannot understand what means 0.5% Spread is|

>**So basically, if you buy a $11 of a Bitcoin on Coinbase basic, via your Creidit Card, then you will get charged with** ***17.54% of fees in ONE TRADE.***

I personally think this kind of fee structure is disgusting, because most of the users who use Coinbase Basic is a Bitcoin Beginners, who don't even know about the mode change on Coinbase, and usually manage small amount of transactions.

>***TL;DR -*** ***NEVER use a Coinbase Basic to buy a Bitcoin***

# Robinhood

I've seen many many ppl using Robinhood as a Buy method for Bitcoin, and I actually 100% understand you. It is convenient, and the same app with you do the stock market tradings.

But the view of fee cost efficiency, it is NOT a good option for a Bitcoin buying option.

Thankfully, Robinhood has way way more simple structure on the fees, let's take a look on the table below.

|Transaction Method|Fee|Explanation|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Market Maker Routing|No commissions, But currency - Bitcoin Rate might differ with the global price|Market Maker Routing, is the method that Robinhood connects your order with ""Market Maker"" order. So it is basically the connecting service between external seller and buyer. Robinhood claims that they tries to find a best offer, but the best offer itself might be differ from the global exchanges' price.|
|Smart Exchange Routing|0.85% + 0.02%|Smart Exchange Routing is same routing service, but routes you with the Exchanges.|
|Debit card payment|0% - 1.5% + Spreads|Card payment buy option|
|Bank account transfer|0% - 1.5% + Spreads|Bank acount buy option|
|Robinhood Buying Power|$0|Buying power on Robinhood is *the amount of funds you have available to execute a trade*.|

According to the table, it seems like **Robinhood offers better than Coinbase Basic**, and that's right ! It is way better ! But is it a good option, for overall ratings ? Let's look one by one on method types.

\- If you can find a decent deal on MMR, get it ! Make the deal with that offer. But, realistically, usually this option may offer worse trade rates than the global real-time price. Also, if you try to get this kind of deal, you have to spend so much attention on MMR fee rate, even more than other important trades. So it is not recommended.

\- Your card/bank has a 0% fees option for Robinhood? Use it! But, same as previous one, it is high likely that your card and bank does not offer those fee options, and mostly might charge you 1\~1.5% fee. In case, this one is not recommended.

\- For Robinhood Buying Power, if you already understand the concept of Robinhood Buying Power and you have sufficient amount of it, use it! it seems like nice deal. But if you are newcomer to both Robinhood and Bitcoin, it will take you so much time to understand the concept, so not recommended.

\- For SER, yes it is a better deal than *Coinbase 17.54% Fees,* but most of the *Crypto Exchanges' stanadrized fee are 0%\~0.1% for Spot Trade.* In case, it is ***8X higher than industry standard.*** So I don't recommend it neither.

>***TL;DR - Better than Coinbase Basic, but still cannot call it Good Deal***

# Then, Where and How should I Buy Bitcoin?

As you might feel, if you understand this concept, **you can cut off your fees to literally ZERO**. The concept is.. : *Fee is a price for Convenience*

They charge you a higher rates, spreads, fees, because they are making you more convenient, feel easy, simple. For example, if you just use bank transfer rather than Card payments on Coinbase, you can just directly save 3.99%.

If you have a will to ***spend 5 more minutes*** on Buying, you can ***easily cut the fee to 0***.

I'll introduce you the most simple ways to cut off your fee.

# Solution 1: Coinbase Advanced (0.6% total)

I mentioned several times, Coinbase has two modes, Basic & Advanced.

If you are using Basic mode currently, get into the app right now and change it into **Advanced.** There are many differences, but I'll only look on the fee difference. The fee for Advanced mode is wayyyy cheaper, and clean. I'll give you the Fee Table of Coinbase Advanced.

*Disclaimer: It is all set as Spot Trading Fee for Advanced Mode, and no VIP Volume discount assumed because it is for beginners.*

|Pair Types|Fee|Explanation|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Normal Pairs|0.6% maker, 1.2% taker|This is for the Normal Pairs, like Bitcoin, only support USD, EUR, GBP.|
|Stable Pairs(Stablecoin - Local Currency Pairs)|Mostly 0% maker, 0.001% taker|This pairs only support USD, EUR, GBP.  Also, USDT-USD pair is 0.005% maker, 0.01% taker.|

According to this fee structure, we can think about this route.  
**1. Deposit local currency (USD, EUR, GBP)** via your free method like ACH.

**2. Buy Bitcoin with maker order** on **Coinbase Advanced Spot Trade**, with 0.6% maker fee.

>This totally costs only ***0.6%*** to you. Which is the lowest fee so far we looked through.

But, there will some users that don't want to spend this 0.6% too. And I am one of those person. So for us, I'll provide this solution.

# Solution 2: Coinbase Advanced + Other Exchanges(MEXC or Binance) (0% total)

1. **Deposit local currency (USD, EUR, GBP)** via your free method like ACH. (0%)
2. **Buy USDC with maker order** on **Coinbase Advanced Spot Trade.** (0%)

3-1. **MEXC way:** Transfer it to MEXC, **buy Bitcoin with Spot Trading, maker order.** (0%)

3-2. **Binance way:** Transfer it to Binance, trade **USDC to FDUSD on Spot**, and **FDUSD to Bitcoin  with maker order on Spot** (0%, 0%)

>Through this way, you only ***spend a few more minutes, and cut your fee to 0%.***

# Endings

I always feel bad when newcomers lose money on unidentified fees, and making a question on reddit, because I was that newbie when I made a first step on Bitcoin, and I also paid so much amount of money on fees. It feels like watching the old me.

I'm always open to questions so you can pm me or email me or comment me. Thank you for reading this long guide.

For the other currency users, I acutally have a 40+ currencies' Zero Fee Optimization research, so make a inquiry on comment please if you need any help.

>***TL;DR -***  
***Use Coinbase Advanced Mode for 0.6% fee***

Willy Woo Sold Most of His Bitcoin Stack... Is He Seeing Something We Don't,"So Willy Woo,  one of the most respected onchain analysts in crypto, drops ""I've sold most of my Bitcoin now"" in an interview. My first reaction was honestly wtf are you doing man?

But then you dig into his reasoning and it gets interesting. He's basically saying Bitcoin might only 50x from here to hit $100 trillion market cap, which he calls ""near the ceiling."" Meanwhile early stage Bitcoin infrastructure companies could do ""100 to 1,000x return"" if you pick right.

His take on all these Bitcoin treasury companies popping up everywhere is that he has stepped aside from a lot of this treasury stuff, like the latest wave reminds him of the 2017 ICO bubble,with insiders getting the early access and so forth

and we all know how that ended .

Isn’t this just sophisticated FOMO for venture plays  Like yes, infrastructure during a gold rush can outperform gold itself, but most ventures still fail spectacularly even in bull markets.Saw on article on [awaken.tax](http://awaken.tax) and the transaction history shows how many ""promising"" projects just vanished during previous cycles.

What really gets me is his retail skepticism to which he adds that he is not entirely convinced that we're going to get this ridiculous amount of FOMO, because retail doesn't have ""the multiple billions per day to make a difference"" like institutional players do now.

The math on his thesis makes sense but execution is everything and most people suck at picking winners.",False,87.0

If crypto sticks around we need places like coinbase to succeed because not everyone is responsible enough to self custody.

You can mine either BTC or BCH, but you don't like risk. You can buy futures at the CME Group for both BTC and LNG that will allow you to hedge risk from variations in the price of BTC and LNG, or even USD. But no such product exists for BCH.  

When you go to get financing for new equipment, and the bankers (that the gas company hooked you up with) ask you what you're going to mine, you know that they want you to say BTC. You've also watched as over $100B of stablecoins flowed into BTC and you know enough about enough about commodity markets in the US to know who's doing that. 

You know the future of fossil fuels is limited. There is so much solar coming online that everything mined is gonna be tits up. It's not going to be economical to mine energy―ever.

But the people who hold the gas leases are GOING to cash out on mom and pop when the poor suckers ""buy bitcoin"" in their 401k with or without you. If you don't want to say you're ""bitcoin only"" then they'll give your financing to someone else.

I think, a lot of people, maybe even Satoshi included, overestimated market demand for p2p payments rather than just for the inflation hedge. A tool better than metals. Inflation brought down Rome, and later brought forward two world wars. Major contributing factor 

And, in parallel - VISA solved payments for the golden billion (privacy for merchants with crypto requires extra steps, btw). Vast improvement over ancient stone ledgers. Nothing really prevents appearance of finance companies solving payments and credit on top of BTC multisigned with customers long-term, in better scenarios in high trust economies - just messages signed with BTC, proof of capital, self-custodied collateral, would be enough for a lot of tooling. Hopefully, leapfrogging VISA wherever possible around the globe

Did anyone actually read the article?

> Valve said the recent dips and spikes in Bitcoin were signs that the “degree of volatility has become extreme.” Earlier today, the cryptocurrency hit the $12,500 mark, which is 25% higher than in November. However, it wasn’t always the best of times for Bitcoin owners. In early September, Bitcoin was nearly worth $5,000 per unit, but the closing of BTC China (due to new rules from government regulators) saw a significant dip in the currency’s value. This sudden and major change in Bitcoin’s value can cause in issue for those who use it to purchase games on Steam.

> The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change,” Valve said. “The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.”

So it’s too volatile for business.

And there’s nothing in the article which says credit card companies are dictating games lmao. That’s not even how that works. Valve creates an invoice and total, and then people pay off the invoice with a credit card. The credit card company doesn’t even know what the purchase was for.

I structured a hedge as insurance if there is a significant price correction,"TL;DR:
I built a long-dated, laddered put option hedge using IBIT. This is not because I expect a crash, but so I have capital ready to stack sats if we see a major price correction.



I hold BTC as a long-term position. It is a meaningful one. It represents wealth I hope to retire on within the next 10 years.

I am not looking to trade out of it. However, given the size of the position for me, I wanted a way to protect against an outcome I do not expect but also cannot ignore. Another deep drawdown, as has happened in every prior cycle after an ATH.



1. The Structure

I used long-dated put options on IBIT, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, expiring in January 2026. The position is unleveraged, fully funded, and risk-capped. It is designed purely as insurance.

The total cost of the hedge was approximately 5 percent of the value of my BTC holdings at the time I entered the position.

IBIT roughly tracks the BTC price at a scale of about 1 IBIT share equals BTC divided by 1,750. However, the options are priced independently based on both the underlying IBIT price and implied volatility. This means the trigger levels below do not correspond to specific BTC prices. They are based on what the market is pricing in at the time.



2. The Execution (Laddered Auto-Exit Plan)

The puts are paired with Limit-If-Touched (LIT) sell orders that trigger automatically if the option value rises into conviction-weighted exit zones.

Here is the ladder:
	•	If IBIT puts rise into the $10 to $15 range, I will exit approximately 25 percent of the hedge.
	•	If puts reach $15 to $25, I will exit another 50 percent.
	•	If puts exceed $25, I will exit the final 25 percent.

These prices are based on the expected value of the puts at different levels of IBIT decline and volatility expansion. If none of these levels are hit, the hedge expires worthless. That would mean the market held up better than expected.



3. Why This

I am not trying to time tops or predict a crash. I just want to have a plan in place if BTC follows past cycle patterns. Implied volatility is currently low, which makes long-dated puts unusually affordable.

If the hedge expires worthless, I lose a known cost. If we get a major correction, I will have ready capital to reaccumulate when others may be forced to sell.

This is my first time building a structured hedge on BTC. I hope I never need it. But I would rather have it and not use it than wish I had it when it is too late.

BTC And The Concept Of Hard Money Are Antisocial And Destructive,"Hello,

Many BTC maximalists celebrate so-called hard money, mainly because it is supposedly “honest” or “stable in value”. In reality, hard money is the most antisocial and dangerous monetary system that has ever existed. It leads to deflation, debt bondage, mass unemployment, and economic instability. This is not theory or belief, but repeatedly observed empirical fact throughout human history.

Whenever states introduced a gold or silver standard, brutal crises followed shortly thereafter. In England in the 17th century, in the USA in the 19th century, in Europe before the First World War. The patterns were always the same. The money supply was artificially restricted, debts could no longer be repaid, millions of people lost their livelihoods. Only the rich benefited because their assets increased in value. The state was no longer able to intervene. Graeber once summarized this perfectly: “The result was deflationary collapse… mass penury, riots, and hunger.”

Exactly the same would happen with Bitcoin, only worse. Bitcoin is a completely fixed monetary system. There are 21 million coins, no more. That means: the money supply never grows, no matter how many people live on the planet or how much the economy expands. Anyone who takes on debt must repay it in a currency that becomes increasingly scarce and valuable. That is economic madness and a moral catastrophe.

Bitcoin is therefore not money, but an extreme form of enslavement. It is a control instrument for creditors and speculators. Those who got in early hope for total power over everyone who has to enter later. The idea that BTC will “suck everything in” is nothing more than a modern form of financial feudalism.

In addition, Bitcoin is extremely unequally distributed. A few so-called whales hold the majority of all coins. It is neither “decentralized” just look at blockstream, nor “democratic”, nor fair, but highly antisocial, antidemocratic and expropriating for debtors. It is not usable as a means of payment, since hardly anyone spends their Bitcoin. Most people only hold it because they hope it will become even more valuable. This is not a currency, but a pure Ponzi scheme that is aggressively promoted by the masses and extreme shilling.

The truth is that societies need flexible, adaptable money, not rigid, artificially scarce nonsense that history has already proven to be harmful. People need jobs, access to credit, crisis support. All of that is completely impossible under hard money.

Hard money is not progress, but an extreme regression into old traps. It leads to brutal inequality, destroys democracies, and renders states powerless. Bitcoin is not salvation, but the path back to the Middle Ages, when the rich got everything and the debtors lost everything. Thanks for reading.",False,0.0

I made a big mistake using changenow,"I want to share a perssonal experience that others in the Bitcoin and broader crypto space might want to be aware off.

back in March, I initiated a crypto swap through ChangeNOW involvin over $550,000. Right after the transaction began, I was asked to provide full KYC ID, proof of funds. I complied fuly and promptly. This case is tyed to Ticket #507360.

Since then, it’s been four months without resolution and still counting. I've received no meaningful updates, no clear reasoning, and no timeline. My follow-ups via official channels have either been ignored or met with vague responses. At one point, I was told publicly to DM the team, which I did but received no reply. Posts I've made trying to get answers have also been taken down on other platforms.

separately, I hv noticed growing concerns online about Changelly (which reportedly owns ChangeNOW), Atomic Wallet, and Guarda Wallet all of which appear connected in various ways, including shared services and partnerships. Atomic Wallet suffered a major breach last year, and there’s been speculation around the handling of those funds. Guarda actively promotes ChangeNOW as a partner, despite the growing number of unresolved user complaints.

I’m not making any definitive claims here, just sharing what’s happened and inviting discussion. I’ve tried every internal route and gotten nowhere. If anyone else has faced similar issues or has insight into this, I’d appreciate hearing from you.

I would replace the current PoW block with ""speculators"", and make it much taller since the layer represents the imbalance in the participants' understanding.

For me, it wasn’t some sudden revelation, but rather a slow-growing realization: even in the best-case scenario - when I won money gambling - I hadn’t really achieved anything meaningful. I didn’t make new friends, I didn’t learn anything valuable, and I didn’t have any memorable experiences. I wasn’t growing as a person; I was just messing up my brain and wasting my time. That realization sat with me for months, and eventually, even winning didn’t make me happy anymore- partly because I knew I’d end up losing it all back anyway.

Now, imagine making that same amount of money - say, $80k - by working hard for a whole year. Not only do you earn the money, but you also gain experiences, learn new things, meet new people, and grow in the process. There are good days and bad days, but you come out of it improved as a person. Materially, you might compare a day’s gambling win with a year’s honest work, but the reality is that quick money from gambling only damages you in the long run - often leading to bigger losses, and more importantly, lost time you can never get back.

Wait… what if Alistair Darling is Satoshi Nakamoto?,"“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”

Been staring at this Genesis Block headline and had a random thought - what if Alistair Darling was Satoshi?

Dude’s literally in the Genesis Block. He was Chancellor during the bailouts, saw how fucked the whole system was. Maybe he just snapped and decided to burn it all down.

Nobody would ever suspect the guy handing out taxpayer money to failing banks of building Bitcoin on the side.

Guy had a front-row seat to the 2008 shitshow. Spent months throwing public money at private banks. Must’ve been soul-crushing for anyone with a conscience.

Building Bitcoin would’ve been the perfect middle finger to his own job.

Probably not true, but man… the irony would be beautiful.

Right now, I’m leaning towards taking the profits I’ve made and moving them into Bitcoin, but I’m unsure whether this is the best time to sell off my alts or wait for the market to go up more.

I’d really appreciate hearing what you guys are currently doing, what’s your plan? Are you holding your altcoins or rotating out? Do you think the altcoin cycle is already over, or still to come?

Is right now a good time to sell off altcoins?,"I would say hold. I am also invested in crypto. BTC/ETH heavy, lighter on SOL and even lighter on 12 altcoins. I selected my altcoins for real world applications - which are now becoming even more clear with the Genius Act signed into law - and what I mean by that is DeFI, Web3, L1/L2, tokenization uses. I don't hold ONDO but I think it has a valid thesis, I do hold SUI as well because I think based on research it stands a good chance to exist alongside ETH and SOL as main blockchain networks. Of course this is not advice, just my research. I too have struggled with holding vs trading them. I am a long term investor in stocks and 25 percent of my portfolio is digital assets / crypto. After deep research involving strong AI leveraging I have come to the conclusion that the crypto market is now fundamentally changing, making the long term hold thesis more valid than day or swing trading crypto. This will become clear in the rest of this year. The old cycles will evolve in more of a stock like environment for crypto. That's my opinion. Hope it helps. But do what feels the best for you as an investor, following both your gut (do not deny it but don't let it be based on emotion) and your research into the assets you are holding.

Is BIP-119 yet another scam from the Bitcoin Core (Blockstream) devolpers?,"> Bitcoin draws security from its decentralized structure, but __it also makes important changes, sometimes called soft forks, very difficult__.

Well, this is an unhealthy dose of misinformation.

BTC developers __choose__ to only implement changes as soft-forks. It's partly a political decision, because existing nodes don't really get a ready alternative -- ie. they get no real choice. They would have to hard fork if they disagreed with an upgrade. This entrenches the power of the existing development team, and those who are behind the scenes of BTC's dominance (I'm talking about those who paid hundreds of millions of dollars for control of the development direction).

Soft forks require some technical trickery to make existing nodes still accept the upgraded protocol without really noticing that it has changed.

This is what makes soft forks less straightforward and plainly, take even longer to implement.

With soft forks, if you don't upgrade your node, you're still dragged along with upgrades, like a zombie.

Pledge #5 is in – Thank you for believing in CHAPA BCH Moçambique!,"Hey everyone!

Just wanted to drop a big THANK YOU to all of you who have already pledged to the CHAPA BCH Moçambique Fundme campaign - we're now at pledge number 5, and every single contribution is a solid step closer to putting BCH on the streets of Maputo and Matola!

This is not just a fundraiser - it’s a real business that will put low-cost, crypto-accepting rides on the road, onboarding drivers, passengers, and the public into the Bitcoin Cash economy. BCH won’t just be a speculative asset here - it will be fuel, movement, work, and income. And this is just the beginning.

I’m incredibly grateful to the early supporters who are helping push this dream into reality. To those still watching - I see you, and I invite you to be part of something practical, transparent, and proudly grassroots.

We’re not waiting for mass adoption. We’re building it.

[Check the campaign](https://fundme.cash/campaign/54) and support if you can

"Clarity Act passed the House, what this means for retail crypto","huge news dropped today! The U.S. House of Representatives voted 294-134 to pass the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act on July 17, 2025. This is a major move for crypto in the U.S., and I wanted to break it down for you all. 

What the bill actually does:
Splits oversight between SEC and CFTC based on how decentralized a token is
Bitcoin and similar established cryptos go to CFTC (commodity regulation)
Newer or more centralized tokens stay with SEC (securities regulation)
Creates clear rules instead of the current regulatory mess

What’s Next?
The bill heads to the Senate now, where it’s got a tougher road. Some Dems, like Maxine Waters, are skeptical, saying it lacks consumer protections and might favor big players (like Trump’s crypto ventures). Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott wants it done by September, but there could be tweaks. If it passes, it’s a straight shot to Trump’s desk—he’s been vocal about making the U.S. a “crypto capital.”For crypto holders and traders, this regulatory clarity could have significant tax implications. Services like Awaken.tax are already preparing for potential changes in how digital assets are classified and reported, as the distinction between commodity and security treatment could affect everything from capital gains calculations to DeFi transaction reporting. The clearer framework might actually simplify tax compliance for many crypto investors.

The timing is interesting because this comes during Bitcoin's run to $120K+, but with relatively low retail excitement. Maybe clear regulations are exactly what's needed to bring back mainstream retail interest that's been missing from this cycle.

Historically, regulatory clarity has been positive for crypto prices long-term, even if there's short-term uncertainty about classifications. The question is whether this will reignite retail FOMO or just create a more stable institutional market.

Not sure where the misunderstanding stems from but perhaps from the rhetorics of short squeezes (which to begin with, is messily explained, especially on forums like Reddit).

Prices shown are the LAST RECORDED TRANSACTION. Every transaction, there's always a buying side and a selling side. If all 21m bitcoins are held in the hands of someone/entity and somehow everyone agrees to not buy or sell it in any form, the price, will STAY EXACTLY AS IT IS SINCE THE LAST RECORDED TRANSACTION.

In short squeezes, which seems to be what you're kind of implying, where price explodes, stems from short sellers having to close off their positions (by buying back shares). This usually happens through the form of a margin call (and subsequently market orders. Market orders indiscriminately buys regardless of prices, ensuring filling of the orders above all else.

If you're wondering if Bitcoin can squeeze? The answer is no. It goes up from buying pressure and goes down from selling pressure, as simple as that. For it to reach a million and above, there has to be more and more buyers willing to buy these coins at higher and higher prices.

As many of you know, Bitcoin was born as a direct response to the 2008 financial crisis. Its goal was to decentralize the financial system, remove intermediaries, and resist control from central banks and governments. This still remains the ideological core of Bitcoin.

Initially, it was dismissed as a scam, a bubble, or pure speculation. But as cracks formed in the traditional financial system, Bitcoin gained relevance. Today, it has institutional backing from ETFs to BlackRock, MicroStrategy, and even El Salvador.

This creates a kind of **centralization of influence**, as these entities control large volumes and can significantly impact price action and market direction. In fact, Bitcoin's price movements are increasingly affected by U.S. monetary policy and Fed decisions. Even interest rate changes now cause notable reactions simply because powerful institutional players are involved.

So here's my point:  
**If institutional adoption keeps growing and these players control more than 10% of the supply,** Bitcoin may no longer operate in a truly decentralized way. Its price behavior could increasingly resemble that of traditional financial assets dictated by macroeconomic decisions and institutional strategies. This would go against Bitcoin’s original purpose as autonomous money.

I'm not saying that Bitcoin is going to disappear as a value reserve. I mean: What mutates is the real market control and behavior as a financial asset linked to institutions.

What do you think?  
**Am I wrong?**

I'm **not** saying Bitcoin will disappear as a store of value.  
What I’m saying is this: **What’s changing is who actually controls the market and how it behaves potentially turning BTC into a financial asset shaped by institutional forces**",False,8.0
The illusion of decentralization - Are decentralization being lost?,"BTC is extremely centralized, and becoming more and more centralized.  

The BTC-Maxi's claim BTC can't scale on-chain with bigger blocks, because poor people in poor countries won't be able to run their own node.   On-chain transaction fees have spiked over $100.  Their solution to this is the lightning network, which is extremely centralized, only a handful of companies are responsible for the majority of lightning transactions.   Custodial wallets have become the norm.    BTC has experienced negative-adoption (abandonment) by retailers.    It was easier to transact with BTC 10-years ago, than it is today.

The illusion of decentralization - Are decentralization being lost?,"Bitcoin needs to be a centralist idea, everyone needs to converge on one source of accounting for value exchange for it to maximize efficiency.

The ledger (aka blockchain) should account for interactions. The concentration of the tokens used in the general ledger, allows for the ability to make value exchange ledger entries above one's economic contribution to the network that creates the value.

In the distribution phase of Bitcoin, centralization of coins appears to be eminent as coins centralize with those who contribute initially security, and then economic energy.

Centralization as the Maxsies frame it is in distribution of following nodes (validating nodes are the ones who validate transactions and confirm them with PoW)

Centralization that's overlooked by Maxsies at lease leading up to the 2017 fork was centralized decision-making regarding the rules of Bitcoin.

The centralization that matters most to the success of Bitcoin is competitive validating nodes (aka competition for PoW) at lease 2 entities competing. (the risk of just 2 is they stop competing. This isn't a concern as at least using game theory it's always more profitable for PoW to compete than cooperate). The other important centralization concern is maximum distribution of tokens, for use in the exchange of value.

Bitcoin Core and BTC Maxsies, have the two most important aspects of centralization conflated.

One distortion in the BTC ecosystem is to view the term decentralization as a maximum extreme, ignoring the fact that it's the avoidance of centralized control that's important, and believing the fallacy that more ""following"" non-validating ""nodes"" created competition that keeps Bitcoin devoid of centralized control.

Another misconception, is that the centralization of tokens (tokens = potential economic energy - in a binary outcome Bitcoin succeeds long term) Maxsies, everyone, actually, believe it is a good thing while demand is pushing up the price.

Navigating the CLARITY Act: Which Blockchains Are Most Likely to Be ""Digital Commodities""?



The proposed Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 (CLARITY Act) is gaining traction in the US House of Representatives this ""Crypto Week"" (mid-July 2025). This bill aims to bring much-needed regulatory certainty by establishing a clear framework for digital assets — primarily by defining ""digital commodities"" and assigning their oversight to the CFTC.

A core component is the ""maturity test"", which assesses if a blockchain system and its native asset are truly decentralized and utility-driven. It generally looks for:

Decentralization: The system is ""not controlled by any person or group of persons under common control.""

Utility-Driven: The token's value is ""substantially derived from the use and functioning of the blockchain system.""

Broadly Distributed: Ownership by ""certain holders"" must be under 20% of outstanding supply.

I've put together a breakdown of how major blockchain projects stack up, ranked from most to least likely to qualify as a ""digital commodity"" under this framework.

🔹 Bitcoin (BTC) — Very High Likelihood

Strengths:

Unquestionably decentralized — no issuer, widely distributed mining and nodes

Clear utility as a store of value and medium of exchange

Fair launch and fixed supply (21M BTC)

Governance is slow, organic, and highly decentralized

Challenges:

Mining pool concentration

ASIC manufacturer centralization (minor)

🔹 Ethereum (ETH) — Very High Likelihood

Strengths:

Decentralized validator set post-Merge (PoS)

Multiple, independent clients (Geth, Nethermind, Besu, etc.)

Essential for DeFi, NFTs, staking — strong native utility

Open governance via EIPs and dev calls

Challenges:

Lido dominance in staked ETH may raise concerns

Historical ICO (but long since matured)

🔹 Cardano (ADA) — High Likelihood

Strengths:

Many stake pools; designed for high decentralization

Voltaire era introducing full on-chain governance

ADA used for fees, staking, and smart contracts

Good validator distribution

Challenges:

Past reliance on IOHK (declining as governance matures)

🔹 Algorand (ALGO) — High-Moderate Likelihood

Strengths:

Pure PoS allows wide participation

Growing community-driven governance

Utility includes ASAs, fees, and staking

Technically scalable and efficient

Challenges:

Past centralization of relay nodes

Foundation’s large token allocation may trigger scrutiny

🔹 Internet Computer (ICP) — Moderate-High Likelihood

Strengths:

On-chain DAO (NNS) governs the protocol

ICP used for computation, storage gas, node rewards

Ambitious goal to decentralize the internet itself

Challenges:

DFINITY Foundation’s role at genesis still lingers

Specialized hardware for node providers may limit diversity

Controversial initial unlock raises ""value from others"" concerns

🔹 Hedera (HBAR) — Moderate Likelihood

Strengths:

Governing Council includes global enterprises (Google, IBM, etc.)

HBAR used for smart contracts, fees, and staking

Gradual roadmap to permissionless nodes

Built with regulatory compliance in mind

Challenges:

Council may be viewed as ""common control""

Initial token distribution favors early insiders

🔹 Sui (SUI) — Low-Moderate Likelihood

Strengths:

Unique object-centric design, strong dApp utility

DPoS governance allows community involvement

Used for fees, staking, and governance

Challenges:

High hardware and capital requirements limit validator diversity

Large allocation to Mysten Labs and the Sui Foundation

Risk of perceived centralization and control

🔹 Solana (SOL) — Low Likelihood

Strengths:

Extremely fast, low fees, vibrant dApp ecosystem

SOL used for fees, staking, governance

Challenges:

Validator costs are prohibitively high (centralization risk)

Network outages + coordinated restarts = potential control concerns

Dominance of a single client implementation

Large initial allocations to insiders and VCs

🔍 Final Thoughts on the CLARITY Act

Final Wording Matters: The bill is still evolving in Congress and may be amended (especially with CBDC bans in play).

Regulator Discretion: The SEC and CFTC will apply the ""maturity test"" case by case.

Ongoing Progress Matters: Projects increasing decentralization, validator access, and community control can improve their chances over time.",True,1.0

Bitcoin to reach a price of 1 googolplex in 100 years,"Given the fact the ""market cap"" argument has been refuted a few days ago, when Bitcoin surpassed $120K, why shouldn't I think Bitcoin will go even to $1 googolplex in less than 100 years?

I sold at 100K, because I made the mistake to take advice from Reddit instead of listening to my own mathematical forecast and calculations.

You remember when some people on this subreddit were saying 100-110K will be pretty much the end, because ""market cap is a thing"".

But the market cap doesn't matter, which is something I knew, yet I still listened to these arguments.

When it comes to economics, most people fail to understand it's all about value, and numbers don't really matter, especially when it comes to fiat.

People want a higher minimum wage. What's the point of increasing the minimum wage by, for example, 20% over the next 5 years, if inflation will be 21% over the next 5 years? See? Numbers don't matter.

There is no point in making (tens of) thousands of years, if a house costs millions, and the price grows faster than your yearly income growth.

There is no point in being a millionaire, if a pack of eggs costs 1 billion.

There is no point in being a billionaire, if 1 pack of eggs costs 1 trillion.

There is no point in having all the money on Earth if a single pack of eggs costs more than all the money on Earth.

You get the point. Same principle applies to the market cap.

100 years ago, there was no company with a market cap of 1 trillion or more. Nowadays, many companies have such a market cap.

Currently, there is no company that has a market cap of 1 quintillion. In the future, there will be many companies with such a market cap.

As I said, it's about value, not numbers.

As fiat value goes down, higher and higher ""money"" numbers will be needed to compensate. This is not something that can be stopped, and it will continue.

Current observations are the following:

Observation 1 - You need higher and higher fiat money numbers each year to buy the same (amount of) stuff you bought the previous year.

Observation 2 - You need fewer and fewer BTC / sats each year to buy the same (amount of) stuff you bought the previous year.

Observation 3 - You need more and more fiat numbers to buy the same amount of BTC / sats.

Observation 4 - You need fewer and fewer BTC / sats to buy the same amount of fiat.

So, mathematically speaking:

Fiat value goes down, nonsensical fiat numbers go up. Value is moving from fiat to deflationary assets like Bitcoin.

In the future, all people will be billionaires and trillionaires, in terms of fiat money, but they won't be richer than they currently are, because the next number (I don't know the name) after the trillion will be the equivalent of a millionaire in 2025, will future millionaires and billionaires being the equivalent of homeless people in 2025.

This is how the math works, quite literally.

Secondly, there is a lot of corruption and exploitation within the mining / gold industry, in particular in African countries.

Why BTC over gold as a store of value?,Gold is not convenient at all. If you just want to store a few thousand you will lose all of your profits to commission when you sell it.

Why BTC over gold as a store of value?,"If you have $10,000 worth of gold, maybe you keep it under your mattress at home. But what if you have $10 million or $10 billion of gold? Do you feel safe keeping that at home? What you’d likely do is keep it at some centralized place that keeps it in a vault and guards it with men with guns. That’s counterparty risk, and an ongoing expense just to have gold.

Gold can’t scale without counterparties and trust.

What if you want to transact gold with someone around the world? Are you putting it on a ship/airplane? Are you hiring security guards? Are you insuring it just in case? Are you willing to wait days/weeks for your gold to travel? This is slow and expensive.

Gold is also only relatively scarce vs bitcoin’s absolute scarcity. We know how much bitcoin will ever exist. With gold, although intellectually we know the earth has a finite amount of it, we actually don’t know how much is left.

CHAPA BCH Moçambique – Full Business Plan Now Live Launching BCH-powered transport in Maputo & Matola,"Hey BCH community,

After weeks of preparation, I’m happy to finally share the full business plan for CHAPA BCH Moçambique - a local ride service in Mozambique that runs on Bitcoin Cash.

You can read the full plan here: https://chapa-bch-business-plan.vercel.app/

This project is not just an idea. It’s a real-world plan to:

°Onboard everyday drivers and riders into BCH

°Use cars and txopelas wrapped with BCH branding

°Accept multiple forms of payment (BCH, BTC, USDT, M-Pesa, etc.) and convert everything into BCH

°Pay drivers in BCH or Mozambican Metical

°Use tools like Paytaca POS, Cashstamps, and Bitcoin.com Wallet


We already have:

•100 custom cashstamps for onboarding that will be provided by the Cashstamps folks full customized

•A clear startup budget with local price data

•A crypto-curious local community

And a live Fundme campaign: https://fundme.cash/campaign/54


The idea is to bring Bitcoin Cash adoption to the real world in a visible and practical way. Imagine someone hopping in a txopela in Maputo and paying for their ride in BCH — this is the kind of visibility and utility we're aiming for.

If you believe in everyday use and growth of BCH, I hope you’ll take a few minutes to check out the plan, share it, or even contribute.

Let’s make Bitcoin Cash real for more people on the ground.

Coinbase $btc price flickering between 17.6 and 18.0k,"You know what's funny.

The fact BTC cheerleaders fail to realize their beloved coin has been hijacked by nefarious individuals (the same individuals that they rallied against).

The original BTC white paper has always preached about Point Number 3, because of the dangers of Point Number 1. But it NEVER stated anything remotely close to mentioning BTC would be Point Number 2.

Why?

Because Satoshi realized, like everyone else, that for any monetary system to grow healthily, it can't be handicapped by the limitations of Gold's liquidity issues. There's a reason why the world can't go back to the Gold standard. However with that said, Gold has its separate place and existence in the financial system which is never going away. It still serves as a hedge and a preserver of wealth/purchasing power, but NEVER a currency destroyer.

Now back to the first paragraph. Bitcoin's narrative has changed. Anyone with common sense can see it has evolved (tragically) from a pure noble purpose of ""Replacing the current fiat system!"", into:

""Trust me bro this is a store of wealth! Oh and yeah, you can totally utilize it as a currency! Just swap it into (utilizing the same fiat system, BTC was trying to replace) fiat USD, and buy something 😉!

The USD isn't the currency of choice, demand for USD is propped up by force. One lens through which to look at the upcoming BTC collapse is it's partially a result of the US resorting to force, and abandoning free market democratic principles, that is creating demand for this bubble. It's one part inflation, and the other part want for change, that's allowing this to happen.

>People are supposed to be debt slaves

Sure, this trope is real, but not guaranteed, free of debt = freedom to do what's important. People still have needs and need = business opportunities.  Freedom is messy, look at the astonishing growth the US had once it freed itself (aka the people freed themselves) from global debt. The US proved in 1776 that a nation can prosper when effectively debt free, The US's transition to empire is fuelled by debt and moral hazard.

>some kind of attack will be unleashed on bitcoin and drive it to zero.

The attack has already occurred, the Bitcoin protocol was changed in 2017 the collapse is baked in, it's not a rug pull, just a shuffling of real-world assets. I agree it'll be ugly and as knarry as you predict.

There are actual reasons why the line is going up. Not saying it's good reasons, just reasons.  
One major reason ist MicroStrategy running a ponzi scheme by buying up Bitcoin and then lend money against those ""assets"" to buy more Bitcoin.

But the one reason why Bitcoin and other crypto will at least not just dump to zero is that it's too easy to launder money with it, by using sock puppet accounts and darkweb services.

The value of actual currencies greatly depends on the value of goods and services listed in that respective currencies. That's the sole reason why the US makes damn sure that oil and other commodities are traded in US-Dollar.  
As long as you need Bitcoin to cash in on illegal trades on the darkweb, be it to buy them or to launder the money, it will have a demand.

It's all really stupid, but as you see with a lot of things in this day and age with speculation, apparently, a horde of really stupid can collectively make really unproductive decisions and get away making a lot of money with that, while people that actually produce valuable goods and services everyone needs to live get shit on.

Try pasting the 34-digit code into a blockchain explorer like blockchair.com/bitcoin, blockstream.info, or mempool.space. If it shows a balance or transaction history, then it’s probably just a wallet address, not a recovery code.

Look closely at the receipt from the ATM. See if you can find the name of the ATM operator (like GenesisCoin, CoinFlip, or BitAccess). Some ATM systems require you to redeem your coins through their own platform or website.

If the ATM’s website no longer works, try using the Wayback Machine at archive.org/web to see if an archived version from 2022 still exists.

Important: don’t post the 34-digit code anywhere publicly. If it’s a private key or voucher, someone could use it to steal your funds.

* Because they only have an IOU and cannot exit (fees too high) those IOUs can be debased.

Bring your Bitcoins into your possession and keep them safe. A cold storage is a wallet that is not connected to the internet and has therefore no risk of being hacked (could still be stolen). You usually generate it via hardware wallet (also not connected to the internet) and store it on paper or metal. Be aware that some hardware wallets get regular updates, which could be a way to breach and hack your wallet.

Also make sure you understand the basics of self-custody (seed phrase, public key and private key, passphrase, software wallet, hardware wallet, etc). You don't  have to understand them on the technical level like how the codes work, you just need to understand what is what and how they behave. Search for Trezor Safe 3 Setup on YouTube then watch a few videos for example, most of the crucial information will be covered. Once you feel confident enough, transfer the fund from the exchange to your personal wallet. Make sure you have your seed phrase properly backed up (only physical backup, don't type it down anywhere, don't take picture of it, test the backup before moving your fund).",True,2.0

More than $15 billion was lost to scams on the blockchain. I know because I used to be part of it: crypto draining, insider pump-and-dumps, rug pulls, shady “crypto loads” — you name it. My main hustle was crypto draining — targeting wealthy individuals because, frankly, it was the easiest and fastest way to pull in huge sums with very little upfront capital.



Now, with Bitcoin smashing past $120,000, more people than ever are flexing their portfolios online, thinking, “Nothing bad will happen to me.” Trust me: everyone thinks that — until they wake up and realize they’ve been drained overnight.



Ask me anything: how the scams work, how insider groups operate, how social engineering plays out, how these networks hide in plain sight — whatever you’re curious about. I’m not some genius hacker — you don’t have to be. Crypto made it terrifyingly easy to commit financial crime, and the odds of getting caught were laughably low.

R. Kiyosaki Bitcoin analogy,"While Bitcoin was trading at $110,000 near all time highs, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author bought more Bitcoin and gave some sort of analogy on market timing based on understanding crowd psychology.

He's positioning himself for what he calls the ""Banana Zone"" a phase of rapid price surges that attracts emotional, late stage investors. Here's what makes this educational: he's buying at $110,000 while warning others about FOMO buyers. 

His pig vs hog analogy is  brilliant market psychology. Pigs are patient buyers who benefit by accumulating early, while hogs are impulsive buyers who chase inflated prices and risk losses. He expects these latecomers to panic sell during market dips, while disciplined investors wait to buy the dip…

Kiyosaki's Bitcoin bullishness isn't based on hopium, it's because of  his belief that the U.S. dollar is ""fake money"" and that alternative assets like Bitcoin, ggold,, and silver are essential for preserving value. He maintains Bitcoin could rally toward $1 million while traditional assets decline.

The guy has praised Bitcoin investors for rejecting what he calls the U.S. government and financial institutions ""Den of Thieves."" I saw an article on awaken about when Bitcoin moves from speculative play to wealth preservation asset tax optimization becomes crucial at these price levels .He's also warned of a potential economic crash that could wipe out substantial wealth, which is why he continues advocating for Bitcoin, gold, and silver as protection.

\-----Only going to say this once on here--------  
Years ago, an obscure article appeared online about a strange, complicated technology. Most smart people dismissed it because it didn’t make immediate sense, and it stayed under the radar for years.

Fast-forward a bit: the asset started getting attention, but mostly negative. It was linked to crime, gambling, and reckless investing. Soon after a rapid rise, it crashed hard, confirming fears it might just be another bubble.

Fair enough—those concerns seemed justified at the time.

Yet here we are in 2025. Housing prices have soared, inflation has eaten away our purchasing power, and governments have printed unprecedented amounts of money. Currencies everywhere—including ours—have weakened, and we all feel that squeeze.

So let’s revisit that misunderstood asset: Bitcoin.

Bitcoin was engineered as digital gold—a scarce, transparent, decentralized store of value with a hard-capped supply. In mid-May it pushed to a new all-time high above US $112 k, then briefly cooled to about $105 k in early June before setting fresh highs near $118 k this week. (CoinDesk, Forbes, X)

Historically, Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle kicks off multi-month bull runs. The current cycle is already underway, and this rally began at roughly US $105 000. Many market analysts now see US $130 000 as a conservative floor, with typical targets clustered around $160 k–$180 k by year-end—and a few credible forecasts, including Standard Chartered and Bitwise, still point to $200 k+ if ETF inflows and corporate treasury demand stay strong. ([finder.com](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinder.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExWXNvNFhqanBueHhIRFp2dgEeG0P2pcqjpNXl9li-UE4TaVMzuHGO9FhxY3ks2dLL27S_tQfxL9tGVI26Rh0_aem_P5qann_huDLWZGMikVeUKA&h=AT2q-UWcVUXtNb7PzZtA5CWjEqcVRl1WqvQ_v4a03k4QI5iaFvI-J-gTzDsiAlAfyr5P3aRqaWtYugarHVYHxmo_ncYYv4Hb8PF96tmfM1zKkPGalNT0ob-OTYTGC4NN-UnWivwdsM1D3u77cAfK6aWPgLsoMZCd6LwsCQ&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT1Fwpx7yxNdoW-4NKsqEHQb-CAdTqKZlkld_09Uhsbdr7HY3z2VrwRFeoG2pJsBsDGiCQwTixp5_TZIpgk19vmr6dxAwb2eP4uKYC6rKJVbQqrZ8XYn3PtMC2VYhNacmBxudBS-di61aNZow1btsZNUl_w5eF7gJwXx4gk49on_wfIqfFXC), CoinDesk)

Why does that matter? Because this isn’t just about making a quick buck; it’s about building stability and options for our families in an era when the dollar—like every other fiat currency—is losing ground. Bitcoin offers an exit ramp from constant debasement and a chance to preserve purchasing power across decades.

We’re still early—only \~28 % of U.S. retail investors and roughly 17 % of Canadians currently own any Bitcoin, and nearly half of them bought in just the last year. There’s room for growth. ([finder.com](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinder.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExWXNvNFhqanBueHhIRFp2dgEe_ar-EmyResUQPFT6xajw2gY-OzVjW8-FCA8rL5PBKI8Lb42hAmDnW2FzthI_aem_j3sHcpgWBHyBjezwjSMX7w&h=AT2q-UWcVUXtNb7PzZtA5CWjEqcVRl1WqvQ_v4a03k4QI5iaFvI-J-gTzDsiAlAfyr5P3aRqaWtYugarHVYHxmo_ncYYv4Hb8PF96tmfM1zKkPGalNT0ob-OTYTGC4NN-UnWivwdsM1D3u77cAfK6aWPgLsoMZCd6LwsCQ&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT1Fwpx7yxNdoW-4NKsqEHQb-CAdTqKZlkld_09Uhsbdr7HY3z2VrwRFeoG2pJsBsDGiCQwTixp5_TZIpgk19vmr6dxAwb2eP4uKYC6rKJVbQqrZ8XYn3PtMC2VYhNacmBxudBS-di61aNZow1btsZNUl_w5eF7gJwXx4gk49on_wfIqfFXC))

If you’re curious about getting started, there are user-friendly ways to explore Bitcoin, like buying small amounts through a regulated exchange or even Bitcoin ETFs, which let you invest without directly managing the asset. Kraken Canada is a solid option for Canadians, with low fees and easy CAD deposits, but there are other platforms too. Always do your research and consider talking to a financial advisor to figure out what makes sense for your family’s goals. Check your funds often and don’t plan to take profits before late August/early September, please be advised, as markets can be volatile. For long-term holdings, moving your Bitcoin to a secure cold wallet you control is a smart move for peace of mind.

Bottom line: I’m sharing this because I genuinely believe we’re at the front end of a pivotal moment—not to chase hype, but to secure real, long-term stability and choice for the people we care about. Do your own homework, think in decades, and decide what role (if any) Bitcoin should play in your family’s financial plan. You don’t want to look back in 5–10 years wishing you’d paid attention. This is Bitcoin.

"Made Big in Crypto, But Now I’m Worried About Taxes What Should I Do?","Crypto trading has been my thing for about four years now, and with help from a solid paid signal group, I’ve done better than I ever imagined. I’ve been able to afford an Audi A5, travel through Europe, and live pretty comfortably in Prague. But recently, one question keeps bothering me: do I owe taxes on all this crypto money?

My parents both professors keep telling me that I absolutely do. They think trading crypto is no different than earning a paycheck. But the laws here in the Czech Republic are kind of vague. I’ve tried reading up on it, and while most sources say yes, crypto profits are taxable, it’s not that simple. Like, do I report every trade or just my annual gains? Does it matter how long I hold before selling?

It’s kind of overwhelming, and I’m thinking I should just go see a crypto-savvy accountant. Still, I want to ask: how are you guys managing crypto taxes? Any apps, strategies, or experiences that could help?

I don’t want to get in trouble later on. I love the freedom crypto gives me, but I know that paying taxes is part of the game. If anyone has gone through this or knows the best way to handle it, I’d love to hear your story.",False,0.0

The $1 Billion Bitcoin Liquidation :Masterclass in Market Mechanics,"What happened in the past 24 hours was a systematic destruction of leveraged positions that demonstrates why betting against momentum in a bull market is financial suicide.

Bitcoin surged to $118,000, triggering over $1 billion in liquidations across 232,000 traders. This represents the largest single day liquidation event in four years. Bitcoin shorts alone lost $570 million, while Ethereum shorts contributed another $206.9 million.

 The liquidation cascade followed a predictable pattern ; institutional demand through spot Bitcoin ETFs created sustained buying pressure, while improving macro sentiment encouraged risk-on positioning across all markets..

When Bitcoin broke through key resistance levels, it triggered stop losses and margin calls in sequence;  High leverage traders who positioned themselves against the trend found themselves trapped in a feedback loop where forced buying from liquidations drove prices even higher.

The institutional flow data supports continued upward pressure. Spot ETF inflows have been consistently strong, creating organic demand that doesn't depend on leverage or speculation. This is patient capital that absorbs volatility rather than amplifying it…

Fighting momentum in a bull market, especially with leverage, is a strategy that consistently destroys capital. The market doesn't care about your opinion, only your position size and risk management.

This liquidation event should serve as a stark reminder that in crypto markets, position sizing and trend recognition matter more than being right about short term direction. The traders who survived and profited understood this fundamental truth.For those who profited from this volatility understand tools like awaken.tax help manage the complexity of reporting these rapid fire transactions across multiple positions and timeframes.

A Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ETF probably isn't happening in the near future.,"Since around 1971, global currencies have been stabilized against one another with derivatives, i.e. futures and options. 

Specifically, currency futures with delivery allowed for international trade to occur and national currencies to float in a post Benton Woods era.  

BTC and ETH were brought into the fold of currencies pegged against the petrodollar in 2018. 

In 2018, as part of the block size war, the issuance of tether was brought under tighter scrutiny, and tether gained financial and technical support from significant market makers in the traditional currency futures market. Controlling ""dollar"" side liquidity fixed the price.

At the same time in 2018, the CME group was launching physical delivery futures products for BTC and ETH.  While in 2018, most bitcoin and ethereum mining was still being done China, the launch of financial derivatives helped onshore and develop new mining capabilities in the US, a lot of which was driven by America's biggest resource―newly developed natural gas wells. Futures for LNG paired with BTC/ETH allowed miners the ability to market hedge risks from energy and crypto volatility. Along with the availability of  credit for US-based miners, this ""fixed"" mining.

In 2025, the unifying feature the new ETF offerings, is that each has fairly deep and robust futures markets with actual delivery. The current offerings from the CME group are BTC, ETH, SOL and XRP. Although it's trivial to make an ETF for anything (especially one that can never bee redeemed) it appears the SEC is hesitant about approving anything that isn't as locked down by derivatives. 

Any centralized crypto exchange/broker can offer cash-settled futures in a bucket shop atmosphere, where they can both act as market maker and liquidity taker. But it's the CME group that runs the big board. 


***

If someone with fairly expert knowledge of finance and markets keeps shilling that an ETF is imminent but won't talk about how that will actually happen, it sort of begs the question...

A Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ETF probably isn't happening in the near future.,">  it appears the SEC is hesitant about approving anything that isn't as locked down by derivatives. 

Then it's a chicken-n-egg problem. You can't build-it-and-they-will-come an ETF; there has to be demand. And that demand starts with trade volume on exchanges, until retirees want to play along at home, and they demand an ETF. This being the case, it will be some time before we see an BCH ETF.

However, BCH is moving up ranks quickly, recently at #12 (up from #30) on the market-cap charts. And a position in the top 10 is only +$500 away (roughly double to $1000, but it's been at $1500 before). 

*What rank does BCH achieve before it can't be ignored?*

Also, there's talk of Greyscale's BCH fund for fat-cats-only, now with the relaxed fed regs, may transform it into an ETF to reach more retail investors, which could unfold sooner if BCH climbs 2 or 3 more chart positions.

I'm satisfied with BCH's slow march up the charts. BCH has more features and many more unwritten future plot lines than BTC. Real utility is an understated factor and supports a much broader future. Things like ETFs, govt ""adoption"" and store-of-value are mere novelties; or *low-hanging fruit*. The concepts are easy for the public to digest and speculators love to serve them up.

But those factors are only side-effects, whereas **BCH utility is a real purpose (and cheap), and plays directly into viral adoption**. The extent of BTC adoption is retarded by small blocks, making it limited to institutions and Whales. Whereas BCH large blocks doesn't exclude real users and lends itself to the massively broader user base, making it open to viral adoption. And when it does, it will become quite clear factors like the-next-ETF and store-of-value (or other hyphenated factors) are just side-effects. Even instutions and Whales will enjoy the vastly superior liquidity.

So a BCH ETF isn't if, but when. But BCH adoption isn't predicated at all on when or if an ETF exists. The fate of BCH is predicated on use; the point in time when the masses shift from *having* coins, to discover *using* coins.",True,3.0

Yes i know this is the btc sub but i might just try here ;)

Hi, I am Brian, 24, from Germany and got diagnosed with a brain tumor around 6 months ago (Yes Brian and brain that’s funny ik). It completely turned my life upside down, especially since i just started working for a new company and who would have guessed i got fired.

These months really took a toll on my body and mind, but I pushed through it and I got news this week, that my tumor isnt growing anymore!

Since I have been feeling a lot better lately I noticed that I cannot waste any more time, because time is precious and not unlimited.

Now I wanna pursue my dream of becoming a car detailer, especially mobile car detailing.
But it is quite a hassle to get everything up in running because of german laws and it is also quite expensive.
You can not just wash the cars on the street and let water run into the ground, you have to have a spill containment mat under the car to collect all the water and later bring it to a company that specializes in treating that used water. If you dont do that, you can get fined heavily.
I still need to acquire all the tools, so it can get a bit pricey :/ 

Thats why I am asking everywhere, if people are willing to help me with that.
I’m still getting sick pay if thats what it is called in english but it just is enough for my apartment, food and my cats..

BTC will have value as long as people don’t actually need to use it, which is a lot of people btw. Most see BTC as a balance on their exchange and nothing more. 

Self custody?  What’s that?",True,29.0
Roger Ver’s Book review,"I have a very different perspective on the Bitcoin blocksize wars; namely that of an informed outsider. An early Bitcoiner (2011) who has sold all of his Bitcoin for Monero before the BTC - BCH split in 2017. In fact over 99% in 2014 and 2015. Furthermore may reasons for leaving Bitcoin for Monero had nothing to do with privacy or fungibility. 

I will say that i am very familiar with Roger Ver's book, *Hijacking Bitcoin*. In fact in my view he does an excellent job of proving the small blockers wrong! The trouble here is that proving the small blockers wrong does not prove, the big blockers right.  My view is that both the big blockers and the small blockers are wrong. How can this be that case? It can be that case if we ask the following question:

*Is there a fatal flaw in the design of Bitcoin?*

In my view that answer is a resounding yes. The fatal flaw in Bitcoin  is the premise that transaction fees can replace the falling block rewards in a free market of miners and users. There is zero evidence for this other that just citing authority in the name of Satoshi. The authority even uses the very weak word:

> can

demonstrating a very weak conviction in the premise that transaction fees can replace the falling block rewards. 

If one is looking for a coin where miners had a very strong influence in tits creation look no further than Monero. The first core team of Monero was literally dominated by miners, This led to the less that 1% minimum block reward or tail emission. Simply put the miners made sure that they got paid, and crafted a tail emission that was just below the historical growth in the money supply of gold. This debunks another Bitcoin myth:

> A fixed maximum money supply is a necessary condition for inflation free.currency.

This is also wrong. A fixed maximum money supply is a sufficient but not necessary condition for inflation free. The actual necessary condition for inflation free is a growth in the money supply below that of gold. 

Well over a decade of studying and refining the scaling, security and anti spam tools that Monero uses has demonstrated to me two things:

1) That scaling Monero to VISA transaction rates will cause the fee in reward to plunge and fees to fall well below 0.01 USD per transaction. Note:  I am allowing for a 10x debasement in the USD! Scaling Monero to VISA transaction rates is possible even though after the next hard fork Monero transactions will be about 12x larger that Bitcoin transactions. 

2) That removing the minimum tail emission of 0.6 XMR per block in Monero will cause the entire security, and anti spam model of Monero to collapse. It is that critical. 

I can see no reason why removing the penalty to increase the blocksize in Monero, creating a Bitcon Cash like scaling models will cause fees to go up!. 

Now I leave the reader with the fee in reward (Average Fee Percentage in Total Block Reward)) for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Monero.

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/fee_to_reward-btc-bch-xmr.html#log&alltime

Note: How both Bitcoins are currently below that of Monero and we know that Monero free in reward will tend to zero with adoption. 

My conclusion is that Bitcoin will fail as both a cypherpunk currency and a store of value for banks regardless of the small block or large block model.

Edit: The above makes the case for something many in the cryptocurrency community would consider an oxymoron: Namely a Monero maximalist that ""has nothing to hide"" (does not care about privacy).",True,4.0

How We Lost Our Moral Agency—And How to Reclaim It,"In modern society, it feels like moral agency—the ability to direct our own choices, labor, and values—has been hollowed out. Why does so much of our behavior today feel coerced, or manipulated, even when we think we’re acting freely?

I wrote this essay to argue that morality is deeply tied to economics, in the sense of how we make choices to survive and cooperate. When a monopoly on money and violence takes over, morality cannot thrive, and people are left playing a rigged game.

I’d be interested in your feedback, critiques, or challenges to these ideas. Here’s the piece if you’d like to read it:

How We Lost Our Moral Agency—And How to Reclaim It,"I've been toying around with similar idea's for a while now.  I've learned that money is equivalent to lifeblood.  You spend your life if you want to earn it. Saving the lifeblood of many others can earn you tons of it. You hope to use it to live in your own way later. If someone takes it or scams you - you feel hurt.  Not just in your pocket book but on a deeper, more personal level.  That's because they have.  You worked for them as a slave. And slavery never feels good.

These concepts have been around for a long time and you see the echo's of them in early American / economic literature.  So the idea's aren't new, just being rediscovered.

It becomes easier to see money as a small but necessary part of life once it is understood in this way.  If your money doesn't align with your values, then your lifeblood is being spilled against your own wishes and desires. I've observed people who live this way and they tend to suffer emotionally and mentally one way or another.

Get your priorities & values strait. Get your money to follow that plan. Get the scammers away from your stuff. Set some aside in a quality way to live free sooner rather than later. And suddenly life get a whole lot better.",True,1.0

For example, Chinese is willing to live under CCP if it can make them richer even at the expense of freedom.  While I don't think any central planer could make people richer indefinitely and I think a robust society shall be capable of handling zero economy growth, the ""richer trick"" does lure many people to voluntarily become a slave.  Playing devil's advocate, human body is indeed itself a dictatorship of the brain (one is willing to lose a leg for survival, for example) over other cells instead of ""single cell creature libertarian"" and this is a result of biology evolution.  After all, it is the tool that defines the boundary of sovereignty.  For example, solar panels or P2P cash bitcoin, being decentralized energy source technology, helps the sovereignty close to individuals while nuclear fusion, a high initial cost technology for individuals to adopt, helps the sovereignty close to states because ""cells"" think it worthwhile to lose sovereignty .",True,1.0

Isn't The Bitcoin Standard a pretty bad book?,"I recently read many high praises for The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous. So I decided to buy it and read it. 

There were parts that were definitely interesting, like the historical retelling of how the barter system fails when one side doesn't necessarily need what the other side is trading, which led to different forms of money being created. And then how many early money systems failed because someone figured out how to flood the system, until gold came around. And then the story of how eventually the dollar was removed from the gold standard, to basically cover up the consequences from past errors.

Super interesting stuff. 

But then the rest of it - so very very little nuanced. He's a huge fan of the gold standard and wishes for it back, without so much as a word about its weaknesses.

The author spews unprofessional vitriol about economists he doesn't agree with, claiming them to be ""incompetent"" and ""foolish"". We get it, you don't like Keynes and would like to piss on his grave.

He seems to jump between claims that are backed with proper and solid evidence, and his own musings and opinions, without much distinction between the two. The reader is merely expected to take both equally at face value.

It's super repetitive, as if he didn't actually have enough material to fill a whole book and so kept writing the same things over and over again.

Built a tool to track smart wallets on Solana here’s what I’ve noticed,"Over the past few weeks, I’ve been building and testing an AI agent to track wallet behavior on Solana especially around new token launches and memecoin rotations.



I can’t post screenshots here (due to subreddit rules), but I wanted to share some of the early patterns I’ve observed just by watching wallet flows:



* Certain clusters of wallets tend to enter low-cap tokens hours before social media picks them up.
* Some wallets always sell early and weirdly, their exit often comes *right* before hype starts.
* When a few specific wallets all enter the same project within a short time window, there’s often a breakout that follows.





The dashboard I’m using maps wallet clusters, flow timing, entry/exit behavior, and even tags some as “early rotation wallets” based on past plays. Still rough, but already valuable for spotting momentum before it’s obvious.



I’m curious does anyone here use wallet activity as a trading signal? What types of on-chain behavior do you think are most predictive?



Would love to exchange thoughts on this kind of strategy. I’m considering sharing limited access later, but just trying to refine it with community feedback for now.",False,2.0

Are there at least two types of market cap that should be counted?,"First one: the traditional one you see on sites

Second one:

A transitive one that includes all other layers operating at least partially on your ""base layer"" network

I got to thinking about this because of the way the ETH marketcap appears relatively low, but then you find that it has a ton of active L2's and one easily could view this as ETH's marketcap too - just being distributed over multiple tokens. So it would be informative to have the aggregated market cap of an L1 plus transitively all the marketcaps it hosts.

Same thing for the ""dominance"" concept, it too could be split.

Perhaps this type of data is already shown on some sites. If you know, appreciate links.

They also created SHA-256, the hash function Bitcoin uses, and have some of the best cryptography experts in the world, which keeps the theory alive.

What’s even more interesting is the cryptography that was actually chosen. Out of all the algorithms available, Satoshi picked SHA-256 and secp256k1. At the time, it wasn’t public knowledge that many other algorithms were vulnerable or had potential backdoors, some influenced by the NSA. Yet Bitcoin ended up using one of the few algorithms that turned out to be secure.

For example, the Dual_EC_DRBG random number generator was later found to have an NSA backdoor that allowed the prediction of keys, but this wasn’t widely known until years later. If Satoshi had used that, Bitcoin’s private keys could have been compromised.

Which specific taxes did you assume would no longer exist within the first six months of Trump‘s administration?

Also, the taxes that you would be paying now would be for the 2024 tax year. Trump was not president in 2024.

If you are referring to capital gains taxes, there is still a chance  for them to be non-applicable for small sales & txns (e.g. less than $300 or so) as Senator Lummis, and some other Republicans are pushing for some exemption like that.

But either way, there was a very large difference between the two candidates based on capital gains taxes, and it would have almost certainly been worse under a Harris administration, depending on who controlled Congress . Right now long-term CGT is only 20%. Both Biden and Harris and many other prominent Democrats had spoken about the need to increase the capital gains tax rate up to 46%, and some of them even floated the idea of taxing *unrealized* capital gains, which would have been devastating for equity markets, and for all assets like bitcoin if it ever happened.

He floated the idea of eliminating capital gains taxes on crypto transactions, framing it as a way to boost blockchain innovation and make the U.S. a global leader in digital assets. Trump reportedly said, “Bitcoin is money, and you have to pay capital gains tax if you use it to buy a coffee? … It really shouldn’t be taxed”.

His campaign rhetoric included:

No capital gains tax on U.S.-made crypto: Aimed at encouraging domestic blockchain development.

Support for everyday crypto use: He criticized taxing small transactions like buying coffee with Bitcoin.

P2P electronic cash might contribute to solving the Stop Killing Games problem?,"For those who don't know what this is about:

https://www.stopkillinggames.com/

__How might p2p cash help achieve the goals?__

If a company or several in the gaming space implemented an appropriate backend architecture for multiplayer games, the upkeep of which could be paid permissionlessly by _anyone_ in a decentralized way, then it would be solving one piece of the SKG puzzle.

It would in some cases enable gamers to keep up those backend services for a game they love - even without requiring source code access - after the original publisher stops paying for it (i.e. the scheduled ""End of Life"" of the game).

There are of course always legal issues and eventually, technology becomes obsolete and doesn't run anymore without major maintenance / upgrade work.

But given how we can still run ancient software in emulators and virtual machines, there is at least some good hope that such a service, easily crowd-funding life extension for online games, could very well achieve results.

I think only the full open protocols / open source approach can extend the life of popular software into the much further future.

But being able to pay for a service already helps, and online service games could display the level of funds (and estimated lifetime) remaining, together with information on where to send more crowd funds to extend it.

"Ripple Becoming a Bank: The Ultimate Proof That Premined Centralized Coins Aren't Crypto, They're Just Legacy Finance. The top 10 cryptos includes stablecoins and centralized coins. Completely misleading for those who don't know, and just serves as marketing to uneducated investors.","# Ripple Becoming a Bank: The Ultimate Proof That Premined Centralized Coins Aren't Crypto, They're Just Legacy Finance.

The news is out: Ripple, the company behind XRP, is reportedly applying for a U.S. banking license. On the surface, this might seem like a bold move for a ""crypto"" company seeking legitimacy. But for anyone who understands the foundational principles of cryptocurrency, it's a stark revelation – a glaring confirmation that premined and centralized digital assets fundamentally betray the core ethos of what crypto was meant to be

The original promise of cryptocurrency, born from the cypherpunk movement and embodied by Bitcoin, was ""be your own bank."" It championed self-custody, decentralization, censorship resistance, and a system free from the whims and control of central authorities. The idea was to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash system where transactions were immutable, transparent, and executed without the need for intermediaries like banks.

Yet, here we are. A company whose very existence is tied to a premined, largely controlled digital asset is now seeking to become one of the very institutions crypto sought to circumvent.

  
For an uneducated investor, seeing these assets listed indiscriminately as ""cryptocurrencies"" alongside genuinely decentralized ones is completely misleading. It blurs the lines between truly revolutionary, trustless systems and digital assets that merely repackage traditional financial instruments with blockchain technology. This serves primarily as marketing, creating an illusion of broad ""crypto"" adoption and innovation when, in reality, it's often just a re-centralization of power under new tech.

  
Ripple's move isn't a step forward for decentralized finance; it's a step firmly back into the realm of traditional finance, proving once and for all that for many ""crypto"" projects, the promise of decentralization was merely a stepping stone to becoming another regulated intermediary. It's a stark reminder to look beyond the hype and truly understand the underlying principles – or lack thereof – of the digital assets we encounter.",False,34.0

Sound decentralized money is to finance as literacy is to the written word,"If we didn't recognize the superiority of the written word over oral tradition, and thus the value of literature for our advancement and welfare, we wouldn't be learning to read and write, but occupy our time in a different way.

It's often been said that the introduction of the possibility of a sound, decentralized form of electronic money, in the form of Bitcoin as it was presented in 2008, is a technological revolution in finance, something that will take time to be recognized by the larger population and appreciated for the benefits it could bring.

The scaling of blockchain technology to serve the masses is well underway in the hands of those skilled in the field, but the ""literacy"" aspect of the general population is what will determine the general adoption, or not, of this invention.

It is also well understood that ""programmable money"" could be made to enforce permissions and centrally directable behaviors on its users, if they are not careful about their choices. One could say that the ability to keep using decentralized, sound, programmable money comes with some responsibility on us to make sure the money remains accessible and does not begin to drain the rights of the individuals to use it away to some third parties.

That requires a degree of vigilance that we need to muster, just as we will need to exercise in our consumption of media in this age of AI-generable content.

A starting point is to ask the question:

""_Am I even allowed to read what I need to verify whether this is good for me?_""

If the answer is yes, the next questions might be:

""_Is this within my grasp to understand, or is it too complex - meaning I have to trust others about it? Can I form that trust in a decentralized way or am I putting all my trust into one basket here?_""

If not, is should always be ok to stick with simpler, yet effective technology that fulfills the task.

There is risk-taking involved with more complex, new technology that hasn't been proven over some time, and nothing wrong with assuming only limited risk while reaching an information level you deem adequate.

For example, even if the most basic user interface of a parachute may seem intuitive (there's a handle, you pull it), it may still be very helpful to be able to fully understand the instructions on its use, so that you know that opening it below a certain minimum altitude won't result in the effect you want.",False,12.0

Is the market becoming too stable?,"Will Quantum Computing Break Bitcoin Security? --> No, it won’t.

There was a time when the Bitcoin community was filled with technical, verifiable reasoning. The history of Bitcoin is filled with uninformed critics predicting failure and with people who read the technical papers & kept building anyway. I miss those days. So here’s my answer in the same spirit.  
  
If you want to create your own informed opinion on whether quantum computing threatens Bitcoin security, I recommend reading technical literature on three topics and understanding their problems: 1) Grover’s algorithm. 2) Shor’s algorithm. 3) Scaling coherent logical qubits (which is very different from just increasing the number of physical qubits).  
  
The problems you should look for, in short, are:  
  
1) Grover’s algorithm, which can be applied to brute-force hash functions, only reduces the number of operations required by a square root factor. That means a computation that previously took n steps now takes √n. A huge number cut in half (or even to its square root) is still a huge number. For hashing, it's like going from Bitcoin's double SHA-256 to something like a double SHA-128. No-one is going to rewrite block history with that capability.  
  
We’ve already experienced stress tests worse than what Grover’s algorithm might cause in the real world. For example, when China cracked down on miners in 2021, network hash power dropped by 66%.  That's huge!  It went from 198Ehash/s to 68Ehash/s but the network continued operating without issue.  The community shrugged its shoulders and kept on producing blocks.  
  
2) Shor’s algorithm, which factors large numbers efficiently, remains theoretical. Despite years of attention, no one has physically implemented it. So-called implementations of Shor’s algorithm use shortcuts that invalidate their relevance to Bitcoin. They either hard-code prior knowledge of the factors or reduce the problem to the point where it’s no more effective than guessing. As a result, these “demonstrations” are not a threat to Bitcoin’s elliptic curve signatures or wallet security.  
  
3) Coherent logical qubits don't scale. Even if the algorithms were viable, the scaled hardware is not. Logical qubits (those that can correct their own errors and run reliable quantum circuits) require thousands of stable coherent physical qubits. And physical coherent qubits do not scale well. Even if you can create enough qubits in one place, they all need to be coherent.  Every year brings headlines about a “breakthrough,” but if you read the paper, it usually reveals limited progress or a complete misinterpretation by the PR team.  
  
In summary:  
Quantum computers powerful enough to threaten Bitcoin don’t exist and scalable, fault-tolerant qubit systems remain a distant goal. Additionally, the number of physical coherent qubits you need is way more than the number of logical qubits you often read about in papers about algorithms. And if they ever do exist, there are still other problems. Grover’s algorithm won’t break Bitcoin’s hash security and Shor’s algorithm has never been physically implemented in a meaningful way despite decades of trying.  
  
When you see big announcements I recommend you skip the headlines and familiarize yourself with the paper. Use a critical eye, look for holes, and keep an eye out for retractions.",True,8.0
Is the market becoming too stable?,"Kinda yes. Now modern wallets are interestingly a bit more quantum resistant than older wallets even though it was not really made so on purpose. The thing quantum computers should be really good at would be going from a public key to a private key. Old wallets used the public key as their payment address so as soon as they received any funds their public key became, well, public - quantum computers would be able to collect all those public keys and get the private keys from them to steal the funds.

Now modern wallets use a different kind of address which is the SHA256 hash of the public key rather than the key itself. This address type was made for privacy mainly but it has an interesting effect of quantum security because quantum computers still wouldn't be able to feasibly reverse SHA256. So as long as you only receive funds to your wallet you are safe. Once you spend funds from an address its public key is exposed - but it is standard (default behavior of most wallet software) to drain the address and move remaining funds to a new one - again now it is mainly for privacy but it can help keep your funds quantum safe.

There is a window though where a strong enough quantum computer could get you even in a modern wallet and that is between sending a transaction to when it settles. In that time the public key is exposed and a QC could find it and use it to get the private key and sign another transaction which it'll try to get on the network instead of yours. This of course has a time limit unlike attacking the old wallets and is less sure to succeed but still it would make all transactions unsafe once QCs are strong and common enough.

So only upgrading to quantum resistant signatures would really solve the issue. These exist but there are a few problems - you would need to get people to migrate their funds to new quantum resistant wallets, which can be tricky or even impossible for people whose private keys are lost. Also those signatures are significantly larger and that would make the already existing issues with block sizes and bloat worse.",True,9.0

"PSA: If you think Bitcoin will hit $1 million, you’re clueless","TL;DR: Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value—it’s pure speculation. Meanwhile, corporations, banks, and even countries are building real, asset-backed digital coins that will bury BTC’s myth.

1. Bitcoin Is Empty Speculation 🌬️
	•	Bitcoin has no physical substance or revenue stream—just a capped supply of tokens. Sure, no one can mint more Bitcoin, but that doesn’t give it real value. It’s like owning a collectible card with no actual utility.
	•	The moment governments and institutions issue digital currencies backed by real-world assets, Bitcoin becomes a sideshow.

⸻

2. Corporations & Banks Will Launch Asset-Backed Coins
	•	Stablecoins issued by banks and corporations are literally tied to real funds (e.g., USDC, Circle) and regulated under frameworks like the newly passed GENIUS Act  ￼.
	•	Giants like Amazon, Walmart, Mastercard, and PayPal are already planning or rolling out their own digital tokens  ￼.
	•	Traditional banks—JPMorgan (JPM Coin), SocGen (USC CoinVertible), and consortium efforts—are launching dollar- or euro-pegged coins backed 1:1 by deposits  ￼.

⸻

3. Countries Will Issue Their Own Digital Currencies
	•	CBDCs are exploding: over 100 nations are exploring them, 70+ in pilots or launched, including the Bahamas, Nigeria, Russia (digital ruble), the UK (digital pound), Zimbabwe, and the Marshall Islands  ￼.
	•	Central banks want a government‑backed digital currency that retains sovereignty and control.

⸻

4. Hybrid Monetary Systems Are Emerging
	•	Academics propose “hybrid ecosystems”: private stablecoins backed by central bank reserves to fuse trust and innovation  ￼.
	•	This structure marries institutional legitimacy with programmable assets—Bitcoin doesn’t even come close.

⸻

5. Why Bitcoin Won’t Crack $1 Million

Bitcoin lacks fundamental support, while emerging alternatives are backed by real-world value. Let’s compare:

| Factor                    | Reality Check                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No revenue or assets      | Corporate and government coins are backed by assets or cash flow—BTC is not.  |
| Volatile and speculative  | BTC’s value is driven by hype, not fundamentals—no peg, no stability.         |
| Institutional shift       | Major banks and firms are building their *own* regulated digital currencies.  |
| Regulatory tailwind       | New laws (e.g., GENIUS Act) legitimize stablecoins, not decentralized tokens. |

Bitcoin is being left behind while the future is moving toward asset-backed, regulated digital finance. It’s not about scarcity—it’s about substance.

Conclusion 🎓

Bitcoin is basically an overpriced, unbacked meme with no future once real-world players saturate the digital coin market. Corporations and governments issuing backed, regulated, programmable digital currencies is where the future is headed. Bitcoin? It’ll be the dusty relic in the museum of early crypto hype.

None of them like BTC (it's too rigid and feature-less for complex businesses such as these).

Bringing the assets they control on chain to be monetised via fees will be their sole focus. BTC has no yield. Blackrock makes their money from charging people to hold their BTC ETF. You not only have to give up your BTC to Blackrock, they'll charge you for the loss custody too!  


Once the mania around people buying their first crypto fades (likely as the BTC price drops back) Blackrock and others are going to want to tokenise only yield producing assets. Something like a housing portfolio, which has ongoing revenue attached, is much more appealing to investors as there's a dividend component and to the issuers (e.g., Blackrock) as you can charge a higher fee on revenue generated than you can on a non-revenue generating asset like BTC.

Trying to figure out the distinctions,"There's a couple of key differences that make Bitcoin Cash a bit more useable as a peer-to-peer form of currency. Here is a non-exhaustive list.

* Bitcoin Cash has 8x more transaction capacity and the ability to increase as needed. This results in less congestion and less expensive transaction fees.

* Bitcoin Cash doesn't allow for superfluous data in transaction opcodes like jpgs, NFTs, and other data that can clog up the transaction pool.

* Bitcoin Cash does not have a clawback mechanism which would  allow a sender to pay to redirect unconfirmed transactions to a different address. This means once a transaction is broadcast (which is almost instant) you can generally trust it as non-reversible.


So in summary, Bitcoin Cash offers inexpensive rapid, reliable, peer to peer on-chain transactions without the need for centralized or layer-2 transaction methods.

It would appear that Bitcoin Cash is a little closer to Satoshi's original intended goal of peer-to-peer electronic currency. He even wrote a paper on how he intended it to work.

Trying to figure out the distinctions,"> why is BCH so much faster at processing transactions than BTC?

As others have pointed out, this is mainly a consequence of transactions being able to be included in the next block on BCH.

On BTC, transactions have to wait more than one block more frequently than on BCH.

Since BCH and BTC have the same block time target currently (10 minutes/block), being dragged out over multiple blocks to wait for first confirmation, will make it seem like BTC is slower.

BCH is equally fast (or slow, if you like) for confirmations but at least you don't have to pay a high fee to get in the next block - most of the time you can get in and if there is congestion (extremely rare due to the higher capacity) then you can _still_ set your fee higher to increase your chance of quicker confirmation.

And BCH nodes still implement ""first seen safe"" convention which makes 0-conf a realistic option for day-to-day smaller valued transactions. For big payments you should wait for a confirmation, but for small payments it's feasible to wait a couple of seconds and if the network doesn't issue a Double Spend Proof notification involving your expected payment, then the chance of  someone cheating you is extremely low (it would require a miner to participate in the fraud against you -- which is unlikely to happen - perhaps for huge amounts, but not typical payments).",True,3.0
Trying to figure out the distinctions,"When it comes to ""speed"" of transactions, we have to look at it from a probabilistic perspective where we talkj about ""time to finality"", where finality is subjective.

Some examples to illustrate the differences between BCH and BTC:

A) You make a transaction to pay for cofeee. desired finality is ""enough so that they give you the coffee"".

On BCH, this means making a 0-conf transactions and your desired finality is reached as soon as they detect that your transactions have propagated through the network.

On BTC, the situation is similar, but since they have enforced Replace-By-Fee on all transactions some coffee places might get defrauded by double-spenders so often that they start requiring a single confirmation, raising time to sufficient finality from ""transaction is propagated"" to ""transaction is mined"", which can take a very long time.

B) You make a transaction to pay for dinner at a restaurant or similar. desired finality is ""enough so that they serve you the dinner""

On BCH, this means either making a 0-conf transaction and just trusting it, but if dinner is expensive or they want to be a bit more careful, they might wait a few seconds and confirm there are no double spend proofs.

On BTC, this most certaintly is something where RBF kills the 0-conf and you have to wait for a block. Maybe they try to optimize things and you pay first, and while the block settles they prepare the food to keep the user experience good, but more likely than not they just won't take BTC instead, or will use a payment processor with custodial elements or with possible KYC.

C) You make a payment to buy a car. desired finality is ""enough so that they give you the car"".

On BCH, this does no longer mean 0-conf transaction. Double-spend proofs are no longer sufficient. Maybe zero conf escrows could be enough and in that case you could get to finality at the speed of transaction propagation, but ZCE is not in production at the moment. In short, you probably have to wait for a block inclusion.

On BTC, it's simple, just wait for a block, same as with BCH.

D) You make a deposit to an exchange. Desired finality is ""enough so that they let you trade with and withdraw your funds""

On BCH, this is kinda bad atm, requiring multiple blocks, sometimes tens or even a hundred block depending on exchange.

On BTC, this is usually only one block, 6 blocks or at worst 10 blocks.

----

But here's the reason BCH is more reliable: to get into a block you just make a transaction, and normal operation is almost guaranteed that you make it into the next block, because we have scaled our blocks to stay well ahead of demand.

When you want to get into a block on BTC, from time to time you end up in a blind-auction queue like place where it takes 2 weeks to get into a block, even if you pay a pretty hefty fee. Most of the times it works fine, but it's not reliable.",True,3.0

Trying to figure out the distinctions,"Announcing a developer preview of Quantumroot: a new kind of vault offering full 256-bit classical, 128-bit quantum security strength, without relying on new cryptography – it uses only the mining-proven SHA256 algorithm.  
  
Quantumroot is an ultra-efficient, post-quantum vault for Bitcoin Cash. It's optimized for business and savings use cases:  
  
‣ With cross-input aggregation via introspection, sweep transactions are 15% smaller per additional input than today’s single-signature, ""Pay-to-Public-Key Hash"" (P2PKH) wallets.  
  
‣ Post-quantum spends cost **\~$0.01 per UTXO in on-chain transaction fees** for typical two-input, single-signature transactions.  
  
‣ With CashToken-based aggregation, **post-quantum sweeps of 400+ unique addresses or 800+ inputs are less than $0.10**.   
  
‣ While SLH‑DSA‑SHA2‑128s (SPHINCS+) signatures weigh in at 7,856 bytes, CashToken-based delegation and Bitcoin Cash's UTXO model allow Quantumroot to use LM-OTS signatures (RFC 8554) – improving quantum security, while also reducing signature sizes (2,144 bytes) and preventing on-chain privacy leaks.  
  
‣ Quantumroot can support quantum multi-signature (30+ signers), cross-vault signature aggregation (each signature used by multiple, multi-signature vaults), sweep-free vault upgrades and key rotations, threshold and fallback conditions, time-delayed withdrawals, percentage or amount-based pre-authorizations, inheritance and business-continuity configurations, destination-based withdrawal rules, and more.  
  
Most importantly, **Quantumroot is quantum safe ""at rest"" from day 1**, even if quantum attackers suddenly steal all Taproot-held BTC.   
  
On ""Q-Day"", Quantumroot wallets can smoothly continue operation – or even reduce their post-quantum transaction sizes by retiring pre-quantum signing.  
  
Following Bitcoin Cash's 2025 upgrade, **all Quantumroot components are possible on BCH mainnet – today**.  
  
This developer preview combines these components with **10-100× transaction size reductions** and code simplifications made possible by several 2026 Cash Improvement Proposals (CHIPs): Loops, Functions, P2S, and Bitwise.  
  
I plan to continue verification, complete security audits of specific Quantumroot CashAssembly templates, and provide an open source implementation for wallets to integrate via Libauth, targeting Bitcoin Cash's May 2026 Upgrade.

When I contacted them and asked what the issue was and explained that the coins had been purchased directly from strike exchange and had done nothing but sit in my wallet they responded and told me that they would have to refund the BTC because they could not fulfill the swap for me because the BTC that I sent them had been flagged as ""stolen"". See attached photo of convos with swap site.

What's even worse in my opinion rather than addressing it or responding to my reddit post, they instead had their mod just remove my post entirely. In order to get rid of the Bitcoin I had to use a atomic swap p2p service.

I just think it's a little strange that 2 swap services were flagging their coin for AML saying it was flagged and their system never picked it up or if it did pick it up they just pushed it back out to clients that way rather than at least mixing or conjoining the BTC to remove the flags before selling it if it was coins that they had maybe accidentally got  stuck with.

I argue that their actions speak louder than their words, and the purpose of a system is what it does.

Bitcoin have had a few big ""upgrades"" since 2015, but when I look at them I see unneeded and significant complexity, some of which has backfired glouriously over the years. Continously making small increases to the blocksize, as had already been done as part of the regular growth since 2009, would've worked just fine. We know since we have tried it, and plenty of competitors have as well. We know back then because it was well tested and simulated. There was a low-complexity solution to the problem, yet they choose a high-complexity technical change (segwit) in order to support a non-mature unproven scalability option (lightning), then spent a lot of time building something else (liquid).

Funny part is that liquid is working better than lightning for most of the things they both do, and many of the reasons is that liquid fixed problems present in Bitcoin. Things that have already been fixed in Bitcoin Cash.

"To have a free market with fair prices, there has to be delivery. If the asset being 'traded' is never delivered, it's called a bucket shop.","TL:DR: A bucket shop is a device that has the appearance of a market. But unlike a real market, there is no price discovery and no delivery of the underlying asset. 

Folks are invited to speculate, as if they are trading, but they're just giving away their money in a rigged casino. 

## What is speculation?, And why is it valuable?

Market speculators try to buy low and sell high, sometimes without ever taking possession of the underlying asset being traded. Their speculative activity contributes toward market liquidity and price stability. Speculators are crucial to functioning healthy markets and stable prices. 

If someone wants to permanently rig a market to be volatile, it's important to siphon off the folks who want to speculate, and get them to go to a fake market instead, where their trading won't stabilize anything. 

## What's a bucket shop? 

Bucket shops provide entertainment, like a casino, but they're usually sadder and it's often not a game of skill—but rather a killzone.

If allowed to flourish, bucket shops break access to free markets and sound financial instruments. They tend to be operated by shadier and more criminal elements until consolidated to a single entity. 

Bucket shops kill the reputation and function of free markets. They hurt would-be investors, speculators and society at large, by not delivering on the promise of free markets.

Free markets enable the free exchange of goods at a fair price, and bucket shops don't deliver these benifits. 

## What is DELIVERY and why does it matter?

A financial contract like a future or a swap is generally either *delivered* or *cash-settled*, or something in between.

*Delivery* means the custody of the underlying asset is literally delivered, which could be digitally or physically. 

If a contract is for oil or cows, and it has delivery, the holder of the contract will get oil or cows at the delivery date. If the future contract is for one bitcoin, it has to deliver instant access to bitcoin on-chain to satisfy the delivery requirement, which means it better be fully backed at all times. 

With cash-settlement, the writer of the contract doesn't have to deliver the goods. They can take whatever the agreed upon price mechanism is and settle the contract for its cash value ""to-market"", or the current market price. 

::waves hands:: They're the same right? 

Well, NOOOO. 

Delivery causes *price impact* and cash-settlement does NOT impact the market parice.

# What is PRICE IMPACT or PRICE DISCOVERY?

Free markets mediate the transfer of a finite, limited, amount of stuff in the world. 

If things are being traded on paper or electronically, there's a disconnect with delivery which can hamper price discovery. There can be an infinite amount of digital cows and infinite supply of paper bitcoin. 

A financial contract with *delivery* mandates that the finite amount of stuff has to be procured, moved and actually traded as part of the contract.

When the seller of goods has to deliver the goods, it keeps them honest because they have to go get the thing they sold, at any price. If they never over-sold, they're golden; but if they sold more than they had, they run into trouble. 

If a large contract is being satisfied from a limited pool of resources, delivery causes the price to rise. There have to be rules to prevent people from selling what they can't deliver, because one entity breaking the contracts they sold can end an exchange or an entire market.  

If an investor believes gold will go up, so they buy a future, option or ETF with cash-settlment, without delivery, they've muted the money they were going to invest and also likely left the gold they were going to have in the market.

If a few million people buy gold ETFs rather than physical gold, they can't really complain if price never goes up as a result of their actions―because depending on the fine print, their money never went to the gold market or gold. 

On the flip side, people can stake gold or bitcoins to get leverage, but ultimately, the way those instruments are constructed, it most often ends with folks losing their valuable asset, without it ever hitting the market or impacting the price. These leveraged instruments can be done in a centralized manner, or they can be programmed in a contractual swap on chain, or a tokenized swap contract. 

Lifting property off someone that wants to profit without selling their asset can be as lucrative as taking cash from wannabe speculators. In a asset-settled contract, the one sided cash-settlement is denominated in the asset. 

Even in the other direction, the *delivery* definition (or test) of a bucket shop holds. If someone is using gold to speculate on leverage on the price of gold, the dollars are never delivered. 

## But speculation is good! ""Free trade""... right?

In the shadow copy of the market, speculation does not benefit the market or the outside world.

Bucket shops lower inflation, by taking money from dull people; but that money then flows to shady people. 

Punters in a bucket shop are NOT providing liquidity to the market, they've removed their liquidity. Nor are they impacting price in a detached derivatives market, the price is dictated however the creator of the enterprise determined. Often the price ticker isn't really connected to the lit market (such as with CEXs that run their own flash-crashes). But finally, bucket shops quickly enter into direct competition with both free markets and broader financial instruments. The most unscrupulous folks take over the bucket shops and they will eventually attack and crowd out access to anything that's not their scam. 

## How to beat the bucket shop.

Real benefits come from real markets with real stakes.

If you want to benefit Bitcoin Cash, first, get the genuine article. Get a wallet, back up the seed, backup the backup, self-custody.

The easiest way to steal something, is to scare the buyer from taking delivery in the first place. Treat centralized changes like bathrooms: get in; get out―with your coins. 

Don't buy anything wrapped on another chain, or a complicated side chain. Don't by coins on a binance chain. Don't EVER buy BCHG trust shares that can't be redeemed and don't have functioning price discovery. Coinbase's cash-settled BCH Futures don't deliver coins.

If you want stability, buy gold or silver, buy it with Bitcoin Cash. Bitpay has a list of bullion dealers. They'll give you a discount price and take your money, and **deliver** the goods. It's real. It's not scary. People buying bullion contributes toward price discovery. 

If you believe in another crypto project, GO BUY IT! Then GO USE IT. If they have something real, that isn't a bucket shop or collectibles market, with genuine organic engagement, we can build anything here.  

But we aren't going to benefit from markets in Bitcoin Cash if bucketters and their paid trolls and shills are given free reign to sabotage legitimate projects. Builders aren't going to want to talk about a product they made if a paid troll follows them around talking about masturbation in general BCH channels.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't need token auctions, or a storage market, or social apps, or yield bearing instruments, or futures, or better decentralized exchanges, or any kind of free market, if folks don't know the difference between a market and a scam. 

Bucket shops close when folks stop putting money in the buckets. The criers stop shilling and the trolls go away when it becomes clear to everyone they're contra-indicators. ",False,11.0

"BTC is capacity-restricted to prevent 99,9% from using it permissionlessly","You might not have known this, but there is a low limit imposed on the transaction rate on BTC, that means very few people can use it before it becomes congested and transactions can no longer get in the next block.

You will hear BTC proponents argue that

> ""It's permissionless nature allows everyone to use it.""

But that is marketing.

Reality is that they (BTC developers together with those who supported them in this) restricted BTC's Layer 1 (L1) capacity to far below what is technically possible, in order to preemptively create a ""fee market"".

This means that when the network becomes congested, transactions have to outbid each other on fees in a blind auction to get confirmed.

This causes fees to rise, even exponentially, in that situation, with rich people (or big institutions) able to afford the fees, while the rest cannot afford to reliably transact on L1 and must seek out other solutions, or wait for an undetermined amount of time until usage on the network drops again and fees drop too.

BTC proponents will say

> ""All users are equal"" 

But when you have to participate in an auction to get in a block, suddenly it matters a lot whether you are the richest or not -- this will decide how soon your transaction can be processed, if at all. And in that situation you will start paying through the nose, which all except the rich cannot really afford if they want to keep using this system.

> Bitcoin doesn't care about your political orientation, religious views, gender, race or sexual preference.

This is true.

However, the BTC network will discriminate against you on the basis of you being able to, or not, to pay a very large network fee at times, or it may drop your transaction.

Unless you are persuaded to use some L2 where you are effectively no longer using Bitcoin, but some kind of IOU (""paper bitcoins"", to make an analogy), and where things become permissioned and you can easily be controlled and exploited.

"BTC is capacity-restricted to prevent 99,9% from using it permissionlessly","The narrative of 'large network fees' is disingenuous at this point. Via Btcinfocharts, the median Bitcoin transaction fee today: $0.297. For the previous 3 months, $0.393. 

The fundamental disagreement is always going to revolve around the purpose of BTC in 2025—your argument only makes sense in the context of Bitcoin being primarily a p2p cash tool (which it isn't). Fwiw—there's zero point in debating this point because we both know where each of us stand, but we can breakdown why your overview fails to address the tangible benefit for BTC users who do use Bitcoin as an SoV.

For the vast majority of people moving their BTC on-chain at this point they are essentially moving their savings‚ because it's primarily utility in 2026 is as an SoV. The real fee structures to compare to are banks and money brokers. The very cheapest money broker (typically XE) has a spread in the range of 1.5% for international transfers, and even more at the low end given additional minimum fee thresholds (typically around $3). Banks have an even poorer spread, and typically higher wire fees (sometimes for both sending AND receiving) in the realm of $10-30. I send a ton of money around the world each year for my business so I know this world well.

So at the low end, let's take someone moving $30-100 which might amount to a tangible amount of savings for someone in a poorer nation—a fee of $0.297 represents a fee just south of 1%, and becomes lower in percentage terms for every transaction amount above that. At $30 via a money broker you're paying $3+spread on that $30 for an international transaction, so around $3.30, that's 11x the BTC for the same amount.

At the high end, those differences become much much smaller, because you're basically only competing with that 1.5% spread. At 50k a BTC fee at $1 equates to a 0.002% fee. On a personal note I've made multiple transactions between 6-7 figures for between $2-3 over the years—laughably low.",True,-8.0
Bitcoin Capital gains could actually happen,"Bitcoin capital gains tax getting axed, and honestly, it's not as crazy as it sounds anymore.
Recent claims made by Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey suggest the bill may include provisions to exempt Bitcoin transactions under $600 from capital gains as part of Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" that's working through Congress right now.
 we've already seen some major moves this year. Trump signed a bill to nullify the expanded IRS crypto broker rule back in April, and the Senate just passed the GENIUS stablecoin bill with a 68-30 vote a couple weeks ago.
The crypto lobby threw around $250 million in the 2024 election cycle, and it shows. We've got the most pro-crypto Congress in history right now.
even if we don't get full capital gains elimination, we're seeing real momentum. Some states are already moving on this. Missouri is looking at a 100% income tax deduction on capital gains from crypto.

I be using  awaken.tax to track all my trades and honestly the current system is a nightmare. Every single transaction is a taxable event. Even swapping coins. Makes DeFi basically impossible without constant record keeping.

The bigger picture though;; The question isn't if crypto gets better tax treatment  it's when and how much.

Bailey's been pretty vocal about Bitcoin hitting $1M during Trump's presidency. Removing capital gains would definitely help that narrative, but remember - this guy also just raised $300 million for a Bitcoin investment company. He's got skin in the game.

The only way forward to scale Bitcoin is PoS,"hear me out. PoW is only needed at the start, to ensure a fair distribution without premine. PoW values external assets (energy) from the external world. PoS values internal assets.

In a hyperbitcoinization scenario, where Bitcoin is the main world asset, PoW and PoS Will be essentially the same. Same security concerns. 51% attack on PoW involves buying 50+1% of the entire mining equipment.
51% attack on PoS involves buying 50+1% of the entire Bitcoin supply.

The problem with PoW is that the only reliable way of verifying that a miner has that computing power he says it has is by making him compute something (aka prove it).

But if you think about it, verifying that a miner possesses a % of the supply only requires 2 signatures.

If you're still not getting it. Think it this way: PoW is a way to verify FIAT balance reliably. PoS Is a way of verifying Bitcoin balance reliably.

And as Bitcoin becomes more adopted, in a hyperbitcoinization scenario, the only way to scale it is either by breaking the 21m cap or by lowering the mining costs. This is a hard truth to swallow but if you give it some thought you realize that miners cannot only rely on transaction fees if the network has a throughout of 7tps.

The heroes of r/Bitcoin...,"I randomly posted on a Bitcoin post I came across in my feed and weeks later was randomly banned. I can't keep this to myself anymore.

I believe one of two things will happen with bitcoin: 
1.) Bitcoin will continue to rise until 1 sat = $0.01 / 1BTC = $1,000,000 
2.) Bitcoin will crash when people least expect it because, I believe, it has become controlled by a relatively small number of very wealthy individuals and institutions. 

Either way it'll end bad if things go the way they should. Bitcoin should not be as valuable as it is. It is an inferior coin that lacks scalability and has been hijacked by the very entities it was supposed to compete with as a decentralized payment system. 

As often happens with revolutionary technologies, crypto currencies have become tools of manipulation and fraud. If you really believe in crypto you should want Bitcoin to fail. Unless Bitcoin goes away, room will never be made for the rise and democratization of an actual decentralized crypto currency capable of achieving what was once believed to be the future. So sorry if that means number might go down and you end up with even less self-worth than inflation has already left you with.

"""The Merc"" is banned from participating in Vox.cash, Unspent and Future BCH.","For quite some time, an individual has been interacting in bad faith with new developers and emerging projects throughout the Bitcoin Cash space. 

This individual is now banned from Vox.cash, unspent.cash/unspent.app, and Future BCH, under the respective Code of Conducts for those projects.

## The problem of a stable global currency system.

There is no way to patent a written legal contract. There are no intellectual property protection around folks thinking an idea or understanding logic, writing it down and using it in their own business with others.

Markets are made of contracts. Global currencies and trade are stabilized by markets. 

So the way markets of contracts are protected is through sabotage, subversion, and acquisition. The dominant exchanges break competing emerging markets to protect their position.

They have to do this because, as folks in bitcoin know, there is nothing to prevent a group of people from creating a broken clone of your project and marketing it to the world as the genuine article. 

## One sock account for every channel. 

Bitcoin Cash is a very small ecosystem. There are roughly a dozen people that show up daily to build and participate, month in and out, year after year. 

There are very few people in Bitcoin Cash that are clearly former professional traders, perhaps one. There are very few folks who would shill buying paper Bitcoin Cash shares (off-chain) representing a fraction of a trust. There's very few people that would engage in malicious bad-faith trolling of other people and projects in the space. 

As far as I can tell, there's been one individual interacting with the community, and new developers specifically, though a set of sock accounts. But, because there are so few people in the space, community members easily spot them, and begin to give off 'tells' that they know the identity behind the sock. 

Last Wednesday, I poked one such sock account on reddit (u/upunup), and got them to engage directly in gas-lighting and misinformation about my ongoing fundraiser for vox.cash, as well as Future BCH, and Unspent dot Cash. They displayed a pattern of gas-lighting and trolling that has plagued my projects since August of 2023. 

This problem has gone on long enough. 

## Lifetime ban.

For legal and contextual reasons, I'm not going to go into listing all the sock accounts this individual maintains. Their behavior exists in a half century of sabotage, and the enforcement action should extend to their successor, so I'll just call them ""the Merc"".

""The Merc"" is permanently banned from unspent, vox and FBCH, under the respective Code of Conduct for each of those projects, for a sustained multi-year pattern of malicious trolling and attempted sabotage. 

While each of my projects are permissionless (there's nothing to prevent anyone from using the protocols on-chain) the ban covers any chat or discussion, code development space, direct financial support, or financial sponsorships through partners. 

## Blanket amnesty for all other community members.

For all other individuals within the Bitcoin Cash community that have acted as a proxy or partner for ""the Merc"" to engage in malicious behavior, knowingly or unknowingly, toward emerging projects, or the space at large, we can assume that you were naively acting on behalf of a saboteur. 

Just how naive, and how much good intent is assumed, is largely dependent on what folks built and how they acted in the past and going forward. 

Bitcoin Cash has no gate-keepers. There's no kings. No charters. No permissioned system of what projects can and cannot exist. There is certainly no individual or agent with such power. 

The most valuable tool free people have is the power to say ""No"". We get to decide who we trade with, for what kind of money, with our skills and time. I'm grateful to the adamantly independent developers and leaders in Bitcoin Cash for protecting this freedom to build without the permission of our adversaries.

Eventually I just stepped back and asked: what project is actually building something real? Not just hype or memetics — but *infrastructure*.


That’s when I found WhiteRock. It’s live. It’s not a rumor. They’re already plugged into **SWIFT (11,000+ banks)** and **VISA**. They’re tokenizing Tesla, Apple, Meta stocks — real RWA plays, tradable 24/7 on-chain. And the kicker? They built it using **XRP Ledger architecture**, so the speed and cost efficiency is insane.


Their gas token is $WHITENET. Like $ETH for Ethereum or $SOL for Solana — but this one powers the whole financial layer behind the tokenization movement. It’s already up **249% this week**. And they’ve raised over **$100M** in their *Fair Token Launch* — no VCs, no lockups, just public access.


This is one of the only token launches I’ve bothered jumping into this year, because it’s got the signals that matter:  
- Real utility  
- Real integration (SWIFT + VISA)  
- Real traction  
- No exit scams or rug red flags


If you’re done chasing low caps and want to back something with legit staying power, here’s how to get in before the listing:


---


🎯 **HOW TO JOIN THE $WHITENET FAIR LAUNCH:**


1. Go to the [**Official White Network Fair Token Launch**](https://network.whiterock.fi/contribute?ref=GAS)


2. The referral code `GAS` should auto-fill  
→ **You MUST see “APPLIED” in green** after hitting **Connect to-the-right**
→ If not, type it manually — **no green = no bonus**


3. Use the **bottom Connect button** to complete your swap **NOT the top-flight one**


4. Swap $ETH or $SOL for $WHITENET  
(XRP support is coming — they confirmed that on their livestream)


Once you swap, you’re locked in for:


✅ 5% instant bonus  
💰 30% early contributor ref reward  
🚀 Full airdrop access at token launch

Way I see it? This is like getting in $ETH at $15 or $SOL at $1. That window’s open — for now.

I wish I could say this for the last time, but I’m sure I’ll be saying it for the rest of my days.  Anyway:

Decentralization ≠ consolidation of wealth

Decentralization = no entity has the ability to freely issue new coins, no entity has the power to censor who can & can’t transact, no entity can invalidate the BTC you hold, no entity can change the protocol, etc. 

MSTR owning 2% or 20% or even 99.99% of BTC supply doesn’t make it centralized. 

Integration with financial institutions does not equal centralization. 

A technical decision or protocol change is a hard fork. The influence of large corporations and governments can try and convince people to use their new fork and whatever strength they have to coerce them, but there’s nothing that stops you from continuing a node and transactions on the current chain. 

BTC has lost its libertarian essence in 2014 as far as I’m concerned.  Everything became about the charts and it’s only a tiny minority of us that still gives a shit about privacy and freedom.

Times that by a few dozen institutions, throw in the fact most miners are already traditional corporate entities, not blockchain businesses, and a hard fork to take Bitcoin to some sort of digital gold storage system alongside Swift for only registered entities isn't far off.

Permissioned wallets and miners make no sense to a bitcoin maxi but they make a lot sense to a regulated business.

To this end I think we'll start to see campaigns by these institutions to sow distrust in the traditional Bitcoin development community in order to 'foam the runway' for a hard fork away from the values that the OG crypto was founded on. Right now that would be a very hard argument to make, but give them a couple of years of eating away at the credibility of the existing development community it will be a lot easier.

Fiat money is a scam,"Fiat money is literally a scam, a Ponzi scheme, where the elites' central banks print money, which constantly increases the supply. The supply outpaces the demand, meaning the value goes down.

So, my country, Bulgaria, is switching from one scam (BGN) to another scam (the euro).

A lot of people genuinely think this will solve the economic issues in the country, but this is impossible. They believe so, because the TV told them so, not because they have any understanding of the system or can explain how money works.

Long gone are the days when job security existed, inflation was low, and people owned what they earned. Nowadays, most of your money are stolen through bills, inflated prices, shrinkflation, and endless taxation.

Also, you don't own your money, which is proven my the fact you need a custodian and an approval before you can use the money you worked for. Your money is owned by the bank, not you.

I don't see how the euro can solve the issues of the BGN can't... they are both literally the same kind of paper and cotton, with paintings. If the BGN paper and cotton can't solve the issue, then the Euro paper and cotton can't solve the issue either.

Just like the BGN, the euro is, too, endlessly printed. Fiat money has an infinite supply, meaning value is impossible.

In the 21st century, the true inflation percentage, not just the ""officially"" reported percentage, is either equal to or higher than the wage growth, meaning your purchasing power either stays the same or declines. Even if it stays the same, inflation will at some point outpace the wage growth, and your purchasing power will drop.

I'm sick of people's nonsense, how a certain political party, currency or a geopolitical bloc or union can solve the problems.

Soft Forks make you a follower. Hard Forks make you a Decision-maker.,"The soft fork propaganda was very effective, and we should look at why.

1. Normies don't understand how forks work. So they were able to sell them on the story that soft forks are better because even if they don't upgrade, there is no risk that they'll be out of consensus. Their node ""still validates"" even though the normies don't realize that this isn't really true.

2. Making decisions is generally unpopular. Much easier to swim along with the crowd, who usually (80%) follows ""the experts"" or whatever the authority figures tell them ""is good"". Critical thought and making decisions? That's _work_ and it's not popular.

3. Miners really do hate making public decisions when it comes to the protocol. They hate the risk of mining in vain in case they'd make ""wrong choice"", and facing potential public repercussions as businesses. What do you do as a miner if the question of the hard fork doesn't interest you? You wait until the fork happens and then decide to mine whichever chain looks more promising? But that can change... because the market might change its mind... So, do you invest a whole lot of effort into something you may not understand (the intricacies of the protocol and the associated promises of the developer camps)? Headaches, headaches. Miners just want to mine, and they also don't like the idea of chain splits which might make their income stream reduce because of public controversy around a contentious development. Result: Usually the majority of miners is apathetic or actively choose to avoid drama by even favoring those who promise ""no fork / only soft fork"". This only changes when they see a huge majority of the public, or some indicative futures market, supporting one side or the other ahead of a hard fork. But the general public in general is even more apathetic about the protocol than miners, so the strength of the signal is usually low, unreliable.

These factors (and maybe more) were exploited to gain control of the protocol through a policy that rejected and badmouthed hard forks as an upgrade mechanism in Bitcoin.",True,7.0

When it comes to BTC you are absolutely correct that it hurts the currency that there are no mechanisms in place that can lever value away from hoarders.

People whine and cry about inflation being theft that hurts the poor.  That is a true story but it is only part of the story.  Currency reflects the society.  Inflation hurts the poor more because that is how our society lives.  We hurt the poor.  It does not matter what currency is top dog, that is how we live.  Bitcoin is not going to fix that.

The BCH community is constantly fighting against a coordinated campaign of censorship, bots, and social media manipulation.

Used to be the bank for crypto giants. Ran its own instant transfer network (SEN). Then came FTX.

In November 2022, it got tied to shady FTX/Alameda transfers and tanked over 10%. The next day, FalconX bailed and it dropped another 10%. Then came a DOJ probe, Binance connections, and brutal analyst reports. All ended in more pain.

By March 2023, it shut down SEN and delayed its 10-K, the stock plunged by 57%, and a week later, it announced full liquidation. Down 99% from the top.

But there’s a silver lining: investors who took the hit may now have a shot at recovery through a[ $37.5M settlement](https://11th.com/cases/silvergatecapital-investor-settlement).

‏Risks of Trading Naked Options Every Investor Should Know,"
Trading naked options might seem like an exciting way to maximize profits, but it comes with risks that can wipe out accounts in a heartbeat. Before diving into these waters, it’s crucial to understand the potential pitfalls that can catch even experienced traders off guard.

Are you prepared for the wild ride that naked options can bring? Address the risks of trading options with expert insights provided by Go btcmaximum-ai.com, ensuring safer trading decisions.

Risk #1: Unlimited Loss Potential – The Hidden Danger Behind Every Trade

When trading naked options, the stakes are incredibly high. Unlike buying stocks or most other investments where the maximum loss is limited to the initial outlay, naked options have no such safety net. Think of it like stepping onto a tightrope without a harness; one misstep could mean a long fall. The potential for loss is, quite literally, limitless.

 

Why is this the case? When someone sells a naked call option, they are betting that the stock price will not rise above a certain level. But if the stock price skyrockets, the seller is on the hook to provide the shares at the agreed-upon price, regardless of how high the market price has gone. Imagine selling a call option with a strike price of $50, and suddenly the stock jumps to $200. The loss isn’t just large—it’s massive and can drain an account faster than a snowman melts in the sun.

 

To make things clearer, let’s consider a real-world scenario. During the 2020 pandemic, there were wild swings in stock prices. Some traders, convinced they could predict the market, sold naked options. Unfortunately, when tech stocks surged, these traders found themselves in deep financial trouble, facing losses that far exceeded their initial investments.

 

Risk #2: Margin Calls and Liquidity Crunches – The Financial Tsunami You Might Not See Coming

Trading naked options isn’t just risky because of potential losses—it’s also about maintaining enough capital to cover those risks. This is where margin comes into play. Think of margin as the bank asking you to keep a certain amount of money as a safety net. 

If the market moves against you, they want to be sure they can get their money back. But here’s the catch: markets are unpredictable, and a sudden move can trigger a margin call, requiring additional funds to keep the position open. It’s like a friend suddenly demanding you pay back a loan with zero notice.

 

Have you ever heard the term “liquidity crunch”? In simple terms, it means running out of cash when it’s most needed. For traders, this happens when the market moves quickly, and there isn’t enough money in the account to cover the margin requirements. In these cases, brokers might sell off positions at a loss, just to cover the shortfall. Imagine planning a vacation, only to have your bank account frozen unexpectedly. That’s what a liquidity crunch feels like—everything comes to a sudden halt.

 

Let’s illustrate this with an example. Say someone is trading options on a $100 stock with 50% margin. They have $10,000 in their account and think they’re safe. But then, the stock price doubles overnight. Not only does this trader face huge losses, but the broker might also require immediate cash to cover the increased margin requirement. Suddenly, the trader needs more money, and fast. How stressful would that be?

 

Risk #3: Psychological Stress and Emotional Decision-Making – The Silent Trader Killer

Trading, particularly in high-risk areas like naked options, isn’t just about numbers and charts. It’s a mental game. Think about it: ever tried making a good decision when you’re stressed or anxious? Now, imagine that stress being about thousands, or even millions, of dollars. The emotional toll can be overwhelming, leading to poor choices that make the situation even worse.

 

The psychological impact of trading is often underestimated. When trades start going south, fear kicks in. This can lead to panic selling or doubling down on bad bets in an attempt to recover losses. These knee-jerk reactions often worsen the financial situation. It’s like trying to put out a fire with gasoline—only adding to the flames.

 

Consider the story of a trader who was sure of their strategy. But when the market turned against them, stress levels spiked, and rational thinking went out the window. They made a series of rapid trades to try to “win back” their losses. Instead, they dug themselves into a deeper hole. Sound familiar? It’s a common trap that even seasoned traders can fall into.

 

The key here is managing not just the trades, but also the emotions that come with them. Breathing exercises, taking breaks, or even stepping away from the trading desk for a bit can help clear the mind. Why not try imagining a peaceful beach before making your next move? Staying calm and thinking clearly is crucial. And for those who find themselves regularly overwhelmed, it might be time to rethink the strategy or consult with a trading coach or psychologist.

Conclusion
Trading naked options isn’t for the faint-hearted. The risks of unlimited losses, sudden margin calls, and emotional strain can overwhelm even the savviest traders. Always weigh the potential rewards against the dangers, and seek guidance from financial experts to navigate these choppy waters safely.",False,0.0

Stabilizing bitcoin.,"With bitcoin as Satoshi left it in 2011, it was possible to take a long position in bitcoin by buying it, but here wasn't much you could do after you bought it except buy stuff (sell) or trade it (speculate). There was no interest bearing instruments or way to get a yield on-chain. There were certainly is no way to short or naked short bitcoin on-chain. There can be no negative values on the blockchain, only positive ones. 

With timelock op_codes enabled in 2015, it became possible to encumber bitcoins until some future date, or for a certain rolling period. Time-locking was a new ""extra"" way of holding bitcoin, but there was no incentive to lock coins, and locked coins were on bespoke contracts and non-transferable. It was a bit crude.

In 2018, with the advent of traditional futures markets for BTC & ETH in the US, alongside the credit and energy to onshore mining of those currencies, as well as the dominant reserve of stablecoin liquidity in the space, trading BTC/ETH became much less speculative and more of a forgone conclusion. We watched fiat values and hashpower march away from the idea of decentralized currencies. 

On the Bitcoin Cash fork, in 2022, the introspection upgrade allowed creating a contract that could succinctly administer an irrevocable trust. A simple unspent output could allow administration of it's own transaction fees, an executor allowance, as well as a regular payment to a beneficiary. So it became trivial to generate a very stable supply of payments, in coin-denominated terms, but the value might fluctuate in fiat terms. Coin-Cost Averaging (CCA) funds out of a trust became child's play.

Regular payments aren't enough, because folks want revenue to have a stable value month to month and year to year. And an irrevocable trust is still bespoke (meaning each trust is unique) and non-transferable (that's the irrevocable part).

If time-locked bitcoin were commodified, tokenized and fungible, and if there could be both incentives for creating it and a secondary market to trade it, then we could do a lot more than hodl or not hodl, we could begin to have a market to stabilize the value of our L1 native coin. People could reliably profit from stabilizing the main-chain, by trading coins locked in time.

Last year, I got funding from the community to create a system of commodified time-locked bitcoin token series, and a primary incentive market. It's been live at https://futurebitcoin.cash for about 10 months. Rates to lock Bitcoin Cash usually range between 0.5% and 1%, but still go to infinity percent sometimes. Everyone who locks gets paid up front, and no one has figured out a way to lose money TMU. Like an irrevocable trust app, it appears to be an idea with only winners.

The primary market for FBCH is commission-free with zero-LP staking and zero platform commission. It's possible to write a coupon where the taker gets just a few hundred satoshis for locking a whole coin, or a hundred coins. Stakers only pay standard transaction fees to place and redeem coins from FBCH vaults. 

It's an on-chain fact that it's possible to always make money taking coupons to lock BCH as FBCH then holding to maturity (in bitcoin-denominated terms). And there is a fairly healthy market of coupon takers exploiting that fact. (... even if [bucketters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_shop_\(stock_market\)) can't talk about this market.)

There are (at least) two missing pieces to the puzzle to create a more stable price: 1) finding a magical steady supply of coupons, 2) a commission-free decentralized exchange tailored to trading Futures. 

Forget about those missing parts for a moment, and lets just assume they will exist. 

If the price of BCH has seen a fantastic run, and the price for some FBCH series on the secondary market begins to drop (high interest), presumably the market is indicating BCH will be worth less at that future date and it's more valuable to have liquid BCH today than in the future. 

For example, with BCH trading today at $500, if the price for coin futures for 2027 were 0.5 BCH on the open market now, that implies someone expects BCH to be trading at $250 two years from now. If someone wanted to hold 0.5 BCH until 2027, they could buy those futures at a discount and make money (coins). Likewise the seller could free up their liquidity and make money in a time sensitive trade now (presumably for dollars). 

Instead of holding coins, folks could make money holding their coins as futures, and selling them for slightly **more** as they get nearer to maturity. 

Eventually, prices for coin futures appear to behave like a kind of savings or yield rate, which is a general indication of how willing folks are to hold coins. People who are in it for the long haul can consistently make money buying discounted FBCH and taking coupons with virtually zero risk of loss in terms of coin-denominated capital.

One of the missing parts (the commission free limit-order future dex) is called ""CatDex"". The other, the steady stream of coupons, will be a chat app called Vox; posts and likes will appear for a week, then get turned into coupons to lock coins two months from now. 

In addition to a future with a more stable bitcoin, the app will include a bunch of other mini-apps, and some tools to let folks write trading bots or harvest MEV.

When folks in traditional finance want to project stability, they talk about total market cap under management, trading volume, and dollar equivalent value. When they get really big, they begin to speak in fractions of the total market share, and projected growth in their market. 

Bitcoin was started from one node. Bitcoin has never needed to be big to win. In fact, a new global decentralized currency **MUST** be capable of surviving well **WITHOUT** being the biggest. 

In the ""bitcoin way"" of thinking, small is better. It's the smallest simplest thing that could scale for the whole world that is the best. If a dapp's BitcoinScript is five bytes, it may be a hundred times better than a script that is 500 bytes, because there is so little that could go wrong and so little to audit customers naturally end up trusting smaller dapps **more**.

The fundraiser for little limit order dex (150-bytes) and the little social app to magically print coupons (215-bytes) can be found here: https://fundme.cash/campaign/28

The campaign will also fund another iteration of every little thing I think we **need** in BCH defi. Although the dozen or so apps are literally small, I don't think the collective impact will be small.",False,11.0

Unpopular opinion: The Core/Knots diversification in Core is actually healthy.,"In a healthy decentralized, open source cryptocurrency, there should not be a single node client dominating the network.

""Hijacking Bitcoin"" outlines very clearly why this is a problem, with historical evidence.

Bitcoin Cash has traditionally had multiple node clients on the network. It even started out with at least 4 actively developed ones, and has always had multiple ones over the last almost 8 years. This may have devolved a little into single client dominance, which is not ideal from an anti-fragility perspective.

Client software diversity is something to preserve and foster, the risk and impact of an accidental chain splits due to a client bug it is evidently overblown (perhaps something of which Satoshi was unduly apprehensive).",False,21.0

Unpopular opinion: The Core/Knots diversification in Core is actually healthy.,"Agreed, multiple implementations are healthy.

Gavin used to  talk about how it was a good way to mitigate risk from something wrong with one heavily used codebase.

There are 2 problems with the notion of what BTC currently is from a technical perspective.

1. The technical rules of bitcoin have never been abstracted into a fromal specification, like they have in all major standardised systems.  So if you did want to write a new implementation from scratch you basically have to copy whatever BTC core is functionally, not  what is agreed in abstract.
2. The people with the most influence over that codebase for reasons of historical accident, have poor judgment and are deeply unreasonable.",True,3.0
Unpopular opinion: The Core/Knots diversification in Core is actually healthy.,"The problem isn‘t the heterogenous node implementation environment (though a lack of it would be).

The problem is that those making Knots, want to change the consensus rules, and they believe that non mining nodes dictate what‘s happening on the chain (they‘re nodeists)

Then there‘s there other faction, who doesn‘t care at best or actively opposes developer/implementation heterogeneity, they just want an authority to defer to, and a lot of them too believe that non mining nodes dictate what‘s happening on the chain (they‘re authoritarians)

This will force BSCore/authoritarians to have another hashwar, against nodeists, to prove that nodes, in fact, do not determine what‘s happening on chain, and that mining is how consensus is formed. In response, nodeists will be forced to wage a hashwar, something they believe has no say over what’s happening on the chain. Well that‘s a little awkward. But it gets better.

Having had another fruitless hashwar, the nodeists will find themselves the fresh maintainers of another Bitcoin fork with another ticker. I can‘t wait for Luke to say „BTC isn‘t Bitcoin“…

I wonder how many times Buttcoin have said it's crashing.,"I've been enjoying visiting the subreddit too. I'd like to think most of them fall into 1 of 3 categories.


1. FOMO. They regret not investing when it was cheaper and think they missed out. Could also be that they don't feel like they have the means to participate (lack money they can put aside, or maybe don't feel confident with going through the process of acquiring Bitcoin) and don't want to see it succeed or else they will have further regret.
2. They jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon when it was spiking, then it went down, they panicked and sold and felt like they got scammed.
3. Bitcoin is new and they either don't understand or believe in its goals or underlying systems. They latch on to the ""imaginary money"" idea and genuinely feel like it will fail. None of us can predict the future and new things can be uncomfortable. I think this ties heavily into 1. FOMO though.

These are generalizations and of course will likely be denied by buttcoiners, but I think it's human nature. To be so aggressive on hating something someone else does, to make a subreddit and shit on Bitcoin as a hobby... I think you either have to be afraid you are missing out or have already missed out, or tried to get involved and got burned.

Otherwise why engage with it at all? There's a lot of things that I think are scams. I just don't engage with them, like fortunate tellers, and if others do...well it's their money. Why should I care?

Edit: to add though. I think skepticism is healthy, and that's the reason I enjoy visiting r/buttcoin. Bitcoin adoption and success ultimately does rely on sentiment, so although buttcoiners are on one end of the extreme as being anti-bitcoin, I think there is insight to be gained. Buttcoiners won't be convinced, but might help us better identify and address the type of concerns the general public have on crypto.",True,1.0

**Why is Bitcoin Cash so important in Cuba?**

Cuba faces unique challenges:

* **Banking restrictions:** Many traditional financial services are inaccessible.
* **Currency issues:** High inflation and difficulty accessing foreign currency.
* **Limited internet access:** Making digital financial tools even more crucial when available.

**Bitcoin Cash offers a lifeline.** It provides:

* **Financial freedom:** A way for everyday Cubans to manage their money, send/receive funds, and engage in commerce *outside* of restrictive traditional systems.
* **Peer-to-peer transactions:** Fast, low-fee payments without intermediaries.
* **An alternative:** A hedge against local currency devaluation and a way to access the global digital economy.

**Club Cup BCH is turning theory into practice.** It's not just about awareness; it's about **direct, hands-on adoption.** We're seeing:

* **First-time BCH users:** People installing Selene Wallet and making their first transactions.
* **Real-world use cases:** Paying for refreshments, participating in raffles, and more, all with BCH.
* **Tangible benefits:** Like the Mesh Network antennas awarded, providing crucial internet access in restricted environment.

To show you exactly what we're talking about, we're sharing a video from today's **Relampago Cup BCH**. You'll see the action on the field and, more importantly, **people actively using Bitcoin Cash with their Selene Wallets for the first time.**

We are incredibly grateful for your trust and support. We will continue to share updates and evidence of how your contributions are making a real impact on the ground in Cuba.

Losing some Bitcoin conviction — has anyone else been through this,"I got into Bitcoin because I don’t trust fiat long-term. The endless money printing, inflation, and systemic risks make it hard for me to believe traditional currencies will hold up over time. Bitcoin felt like a rational hedge — a way to opt out and protect value.

But lately, I’ve been second-guessing things. The more I’ve learned, the more questions I have:

- What happens when the block subsidy keeps shrinking? Fees still seem too low to sustain security.

- Is tail emission the only way for sustaining long-term blockchain security? 

- Governments are still circling. Regulatory pressure could hit hard.
  
- Stablecoins like USDT might be propping up the price — and I’m not sure how solid that foundation is.

I’m not looking for hype or financial advice. I’m just trying to figure out if I should keep stacking or step back a bit until things feel clearer.

- never ""invest"" more than you can afford to lose
- diversify (""take profit"") by converting some profitable slice into other things (prioritise that which you need unless your basic needs are fully met and you can afford to speculate)

Losing some Bitcoin conviction — has anyone else been through this,"Over the past ten years or so I went from skeptical to on board to completely out in regard to BTC other than occasional swing trades when it dips/rises a lot.

People will yell that it's not a ponzi until they are blue in the face and that's technically true, it's not a ponzi, but they miss the whole reason for the comparison. For the price to keep going up, people have to keep pumping in cash, and at the current price level, the amount of fiat that has to get pumped into BTC to 2x, 5x, or 10x is absolutely astronomical. And as soon as people stop pumping in cash, it collapses. And the sort of financial catastrophy that bitcoiners salivate over, that they think would push it into the millions, would ultimately just wipe BTC out to zero.

Bitcoin is a great proof of concept, but it can't scale so fails miserably as an actual currency, and it is purely speculative as a ""store of value"", so isn't really a store of value. People buy it because they think it will go up, and as soon as they no longer think it will go up, they sell it.

There is a weird religion around bitcoin, and the bitcoin sub can be a rather convincing echo chamber. It centers on the idea that by sacrificing in the short term and pinching pennies to put everything into BTC will provide future wealth, and that is scarily reminiscent of the church hundreds of years ago promising paradise in the afterlife to make peasants more accepting of being destitute.

Bitcoin can never be a monetary standard for traditional monetary uses. And why do we even refer to it as a coin or token? It is code. It has no physical form at all.

Now, you can speculate that for some reason, a digital code (that you can’t touch, that doesn’t produce anything and that doesn’t generate any economic value) might increase in price forever. No one here can tell you if that will or won’t happen or when it could end. Because it’s pure speculation and the only factor that can move Bitcoin higher is a constant inflow of money exceeding the outflow. The larger Bitcoin gets, the larger the inflow required.

Once rewards are gone, it's entirely transactions fees.

Any thoughts on small blocks arguments?,"I am banned over in that sub, but I took a quick look at the thread.

Top arguments:

>  Lightning network allows you to perform a trust-less transaction in seconds, a bigger block size doesn’t. 

I guess if you erase common sense, and make them forget about 0-conf (which is still trustless despite that you still have to wait for confirmations), then the above makes sense.

Otherwise: Even with LN, you're still trusting that you can settle on chain in future. Otherwise that money isn't yours. See other posters in this thread for why that requires big trust that more corporations and institutions won't try to use L1.

> Do we just continue increasing the block size every few years as transaction volume increases? Continuously hard forking bitcoin will erode the value proposition of bitcoin.

They have been thoroughly trained to equate bigger blocks with hard forks as if that is something bad. There are coins which __automatically__ adjust the blocksize upwards when needed. Like Monero. Or Bitcoin Cash. It's written into consensus, and while it will demand more resources if the chain adoption grows - that adoption is what makes the coin valuable. It pays for itself.

> If you keep increasing the size to keep the transaction price down, people will come up with dumb things to store on the blockchain because the price is artificially low.

This argument has a kernel of truth in the extreme case, but in the sensible middle road of scaling it ignores 3 things:

- Miners control what transactions are acceptable, and ultimately, what level of fees and how big the blocks become (despite the max size cap). This is a market, it is not ""artificially keeping fees low"". I repeat, a fee market exists even when the blocksize is not capped in such a way as to create always full blocks.

- For coins that actually have value, having more blockspace means that spamming the network becomes harder. For a coin with adequate capacity, even if someone tries to spam it, they'll not easily be able to exclude the other paying traffic, so it's ""business as usual"" for paying customers, while on a small block coin like BTC, the chain becomes congested, fees and confirmation times become unpredictable, essentially killing even the reliable settlement use case.

- In the history of coins with bigger block sizes, unless you go to immediate extremes without doing the intermediate work of actually scaling, there is no problem with spam. Take Bitcoin Cash. Spam is not an issue on it. Discussing this always ends with small blockers saying ""_oh, but it's because the coin isn't as valuable as BTC._"". No - it's because it would end up more costly to spam, that is why people can spam the small block chains in the first place, even though the small block size is supposed to help defend against it. But the mechanism of defense - rapidly excluding other transactions to create a blind fee auction - is very unhealthy. Bigger blocks alleviate that and give miners time to assess the spam source and protect the network. Which they have done in the past, repeatedly, on BCH (and probably the miners of other coins too).

> Miners doesn't control the network, nodes does

But miners (more accurately: pools) control what gets into a block, and how big the relevant mempools are that feed this decision.

This is what ends up being the history of the blockchain. Not what non-mining nodes thought about it. They must follow the decisions of the miners, or fork off and become miners themselves on a new chain.

> Block size scarcity means transactions must bid for priority. This is what funds bitcoin's security model into the far future. 

It is adoption that funds the security model. Not high fee amounts, but large aggregate amounts of fees due to many, many transactions. Satoshi said the same thing: (paraphrase) Either Bitcoin will have no transactions, or it will have very many transactions. That was talking about the blockchain itself, and necessitates adequately-sized blocks to handle the transactions. Pruning and sharding can keep storage requirements low enough for the individual node, SPV is enough to use the chain for payments (no need to even run a node unless you have a use case that really requires it).",True,6.0

BTC about to pull the classic weekend rug... calling it now,"Anyone else watching this Iran/Israel situation and thinking BTC's acting way too strong?? Like we should've dumped hard by now but we're just... grinding sideways.. 

BTC's been teasing the top of the range for days now and honestly the fact that it hasn't completely face planted yet is kinda bullish long-term... But short-term momentum on everything below the 4h is screaming downside.
Here's my take;; We're gonna get this boring low-vol action for maybe 2-3 more days then BOOM... weekend or Monday morning massacre incoming.....

First stop probably 102.6k at the 55 daily EMA where all the ""buy the dip"" crowd will jump in thinking they're smart ;; But I'm betting we go WAY lower before this month's over. My real buy zone is still that 97-99k range where the monthly 5EMA sits... that's where the real panic selling happens.

ran the numbers last night with Awaken.tax’s scenario tool *on this exact dip-buying plan. If we hit 97k and I scale in, it auto-crunched the tax drag on my profit targets if we rebound to 120k.

Plot twist though... I'm not even touching shorts yet because you know how this game works. We'll probably get some random relief bounce first or just sideways chop to bore everyone to death before the real move.
But listen... if you're thinking long-term, buying BTC under 102k and ETH under $2500 is probably gonna look genius in 6 months. Problem is we might get that beautiful flush and panic selling first that sends normies running for the hills.......

Dubai  made Bitcoin payments official for government services while the IRS is hunting $10k DeFi trades.,"While everyone's arguing about regulations in the West, Dubai government signed an MOU with Crypto.com, to accept Bitcoin and crypto payments for government fees. You can literally pay your taxes and government services with Bitcoin now.
But here's what makes this actually revolutionary for your portfolio:
The tax math is brutal everywhere else: US crypto traders face up to 37% short-term capital gains, UK hits you with 20% on gains over £6,000, Germany taxes crypto as income up to 45%. Meanwhile in Dubai? Zero income tax, zero capital gains tax, zero tax on staking rewards. Not just Bitcoin - ALL cryptocurrencies;

This isn't just Bitcoin anymore. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets aren't legal tender, they're fully recognized and tradeable with NFTs paying zero tax for personal collectors. Dubai's VARA framework covers everything from DeFi protocols to altcoins...

 Dubai has become a global hotspot for expat crypto investors with trader sentiment shifting toward Dubai-friendly strategies. UAE handled $25+ billion in crypto volume before government adoption even started.
Compare this to the regulatory uncertainty elsewhere, and Dubai's positioning itself as the jurisdiction that actually gets it. They're not just tolerating crypto - they're making it part of their government infrastructure while keeping your gains untaxed.

The kicker is  Crypto market cap could hit $3.3T-$3.5T in Q2 2025. If you're sitting on serious gains, the Dubai tax advantage isn't just attractive it's potentially life-changing. I mean it’s definately desirable . 
What are your thoughts? Is this the kind of institutional adoption that changes everything…..
Also is it worth it to move to dubai just for that

Wild how this changes the math. A trader friend who did relocate to Dubai last year had used (https://awaken.tax/) to simulate his tax savings before moving.

"Why extended UTXO is superior for Bitcoin DeFi, and not account based chains like Solana and Ethereum.","Yes, the statement implies a security advantage, and based on the research material, the combined BitVMX/Cardano EUTXO/RISC-V approach is generally considered to offer a higher degree of security and reduced trust assumptions compared to account-based models like EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and SVM (Solana Virtual Machine), especially for Bitcoin integration.
Here's a breakdown of why this security posture is often considered superior:
Security Advantages of UTXO/EUTXO/BitVMX over Account-Based Models
1. Deterministic Smart Contracts and Predictable Outcomes (EUTXO)
 * EUTXO Model: Cardano's Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model means that the validity and outcome of a transaction are known before it is submitted to the blockchain. This is a significant security boon for decentralized finance (DeFi).
 * No Global State: Unlike account-based models that rely on a shared global state that can change during transaction validation, EUTXO transactions depend only on their specific inputs. This eliminates unexpected failures, ""gas wars,"" and many forms of front-running/Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) that can plague account-based systems. This predictability reduces the attack surface and makes smart contracts more reliable.
 * Reduced Race Conditions: The deterministic nature of EUTXO helps prevent issues like race conditions during contract execution, which can compromise transaction integrity in account-based models.
2. Trust-Minimized Bitcoin Interoperability (BitVMX)
 * On-Chain Enforcement on Bitcoin: BitVMX leverages Bitcoin's existing security model (hashlocks, timelocks, and fraud proofs) to ensure that any dispute is ultimately resolved on the Bitcoin blockchain itself. This means the security of your Bitcoin assets remains tied to Bitcoin's unparalleled security, not a separate bridge's security.
 * 1-of-N Honest Participant Model: BitVMX operates on a ""1-of-N Honest Participant Model,"" meaning that as long as at least one honest verifier exists, fraud can be proven and the correct outcome enforced on Bitcoin. This is a much weaker and more robust trust assumption than requiring a supermajority of potentially fallible or malicious custodians, which is common in many bridging solutions.
 * Off-Chain Computation, On-Chain Verification: Complex computations (running a RISC-V virtual machine) happen off-chain, minimizing the data written to Bitcoin. Only proofs of fraud are published on-chain during a dispute, making it highly efficient and scalable while maintaining Bitcoin's security properties.
 * No Protocol Changes: BitVMX works within Bitcoin's existing Script capabilities, requiring no soft or hard forks, which is crucial for Bitcoin's stability and security.
 * Reduced Attack Surface for Bridges: Instead of relying on custodial multi-signature schemes, BitVMX uses cryptographic proofs and game theory to disincentivize fraud, inherently making it more secure than most existing wrapped BTC solutions.
3. Secure and Auditable Virtual Machine (RISC-V)
 * Open Standard: RISC-V is an open standard, meaning its specification is transparent and auditable by anyone. This increases the likelihood of discovering and fixing vulnerabilities, contrasting with proprietary instruction set architectures.
 * Verifiable Computation: When Cardano smart contracts (UPLC) are compiled to RISC-V for BitVMX, it leverages a well-understood and secure instruction set for verifiable computation.
4. Inherent UTXO Security Properties
 * Immutability: In the UTXO model, each unit of currency is treated as a discrete, immutable object. A UTXO either exists in its anticipated form or it does not, which enhances security compared to the account model that requires meticulous verification of account status during transactions.
 * Traceability: The UTXO model offers better traceability of funds.
Considerations for Account-Based Models (EVM/SVM)
While account-based models like Ethereum and Solana offer flexibility and ease of use for developers due to their global state and imperative programming paradigms, this comes with certain trade-offs in security and predictability:
 * Global State Complexity: The reliance on a global state can lead to complexities and new classes of errors, especially in concurrent, safety-critical contexts.
 * Race Conditions and MEV: The mutable nature of accounts and global state can make them more susceptible to issues like front-running, sandwich attacks, and other forms of MEV, where malicious actors can exploit transaction ordering for profit.
 * Complexity and Security Risks: While Turing-complete languages allow for complex computations, this flexibility can introduce increased complexity and potential security risks, requiring mechanisms like ""gas"" to limit computation and prevent abuse.
 * Bridging Risks: Traditional bridging solutions for wrapped assets (like WBTC on Ethereum) often rely on centralized custodians or multi-signature schemes, which introduce trust assumptions and potential points of failure not present in the BitVMX approach.
In summary, the combined BitVMX/Cardano EUTXO/RISC-V approach prioritizes trust minimization through cryptographic proofs, on-chain enforcement on Bitcoin itself (for Bitcoin assets), deterministic execution, and formal verification. This creates a more robust and predictable environment for DeFi logic, particularly when integrating with Bitcoin's security model.

Becasue the real reason to keep the blocksize small is not related to scaling.

Rather than admit that there is a fundamental flaw in Bitcoin with the 21000000 BTC limit and the falling blcok rewards the bitcoin maxis (small block variant) say that keeping blocks small is necessary for decentralization..

> Why is no one at core even looking into improving L1 scaling? There are a dozen things one could do to improve throughput even with a fixed blocksize limit.

Because having a symmetrical 5Gbps home internet connection over fibre will not cause transaction fees  to replace the falling block rewards, regardless of the size of the blocks.

Meanwhile, Grayscale's GBTC surprised me. Sure, it's still seeing net outflows overall, but I noticed several days last week where money was actually flowing back in. That's not the one-way exit everyone predicted.
Here's what I think is really happening: Institutional money isn't panicking. They're calculating. While retail investors often react to headlines, the big players seem to be treating recent price drops as  opportunities. The timing makes sense with all the uncertainty around inflation and Fed policy, Bitcoin is starting to look like a hedge play again.
What fascinates me is how this contradicts the prevailing sentiment ; the actual money flows suggest something different. Professional investors are quietly accumulating while everyone else fixates on macro headwinds.
I'm curious about your take on this disconnect. Are we seeing smart money positioning for the next cycle, or is this just temporary tactical buying before another leg down?

Speaking of seeing what others miss... All this staring at dashboards and spotting hidden inflows reminded me of tax season. I used to dread it ;felt like I was leaving money on the table . Then i'd started using Awaken.tax. It finds crypto tax deductions and credits you didn't even know existed, especially for DeFi, staking, and NFTs.",False,20.0

For ZKP-interested devs: BCH is uniquely well suited to trustless on-chain verification of STARKs vs. pairing-based proofs. It may be wise to leapfrog EC pairing and start with STARKs.

Also beware of the ""L1 can't scale"" zeitgeist: BCH hasn't made ETH's scaling mistakes, and ZKPs aren't a prerequisite for BCH's global-reserve-currency scale.

Various intro material for BCH devs:

- https://l2ivresearch.substack.com/p/recursive-proofs-in-stwo-part-ii

Also, PSA, you can ""SIMD within a register"" using BCH's very long VM numbers. Maybe useful for reducing opCost (and resulting TX sizes) by replacing naive MUL/DIV/MOD with cheap arithmetic/shifts in FRI and other algorithms: https://aszepieniec.github.io/stark-anatomy/fri

---

Also, use OP_IFDUP to save a byte here and there! E.g. a definite loop pushing another `<1>` to the stack during each round: (CashAssembly:)

    // Add many items to the stack
    <5> OP_BEGIN
    OP_1SUB
    OP_TOALTSTACK
    // -- anything on main stack
    <1>
    // -- end
    OP_FROMALTSTACK
    OP_IFDUP OP_NOT
    OP_UNTIL

More: https://github.com/bitjson/bch-loops

That SIMD/SWAR trick seems most likely to be useful for 128+ ""lane"" FRI folds, but might also be useful for slightly more opCost-efficient Poseidon2 rounds (if using Poseidon2 reduces overall byte length vs. SHA-256). I don't think it offers savings for NTTs without refining MUL's cost (and commensurately stricter VM performance requirements), but please prove me wrong and/or CHIP it. 🚀

Of course, if you're at this level of optimization, consider CHIPing a reduction in Base Instruction Cost, too. The 2025 upgrade's 100 is ""crawl before walking"", and IIRC BCHN can already 10x it (i.e. base cost of 10).",True,5.0

Which crypto is currently the best for the “stable” long term but with a small return?,"Hello everyone,
I'm slowly starting out in cryptos and I'm looking for a “stable” or low-volatility crypto, which I could use to put a little aside each month, like a sort of personal savings account.
I'm not looking to get rich quick, just a small, regular return over the long term, but without too much risk.

I ask myself questions like:
	• Are there stablecoins (USDC, DAI, etc.) that earn something on staking?
	• Or cryptos deemed more stable in the long term (eg: ETH, ATOM, etc.) but with a little staking?
	• Are certain tokens or blockchains reliable and solid in 2025 for this type of strategy?

📈 Which crypto is currently the best for “stable” long term but with a small return?,"Hello everyone,
I'm slowly starting out in cryptos and I'm looking for a “stable” or low-volatility crypto, which I could use to put a little aside each month, like a sort of personal savings account.
I'm not looking to get rich quick, just a small, regular return over the long term, but without too much risk.

I ask myself questions like:
	• Are there stablecoins (USDC, DAI, etc.) that earn something on staking?
	• Or cryptos deemed more stable in the long term (eg: ETH, ATOM, etc.) but with a little staking?
	• Are certain tokens or blockchains reliable and solid in 2025 for this type of strategy?

I specify that I store my cryptos on a hardware wallet (Tangem Ring) so I am looking for cryptos compatible with this format too.

Thank you for your advice! 🙏

Hi, u/Nearby-Reward4393. Your question looks reasonable, but you may want to know more on the subject:

The term of ""crypto"" is rather unfortunate, since it does not put well what these items are. I hope it helps you to know that all these items actually are book-entry coins.

Let us start with ""stablecoins"": Per the nomenclature used by Ludwig von Mises, these actually are credit coins, i.e. they are coins with a central authority. For a ""USD-tethered stablecoin"", the central authority of the coin collects investor money and promises to keep the exchange rate of the coin to USD at 1:1.

Can you get a positive return by buying and holding a ""USD-tethered stablecoin""? Normally not. In case you want to lend your capital, a conservative strategy is to buy some reputable bonds, not to buy any ""stablecoins"" and ""stake"" them.

The main group of the book-entry coins are the coins that can be classified as commodities. For a coin classifiable as a commodity, you do not need to trust any central authority (because there is none) to maintain the value of the coin. As far as I know, the coin classifiable as a commodity with the lowest historical volatility is BTC, having annualized four-year volatility of 56%.",True,1.0

From $12k to $130k......and I'm scared to sell now,"I’ve been riding this roller coaster since late 2019.....
 I started small just a few hundred bucks every month comforting myself it was ‘dumb money.' But then 2020 hit, and my side hustle as a barista was lost when lockdowns began. Student loans , little carelessness with spending , few medical bills due to some family issues. Watching my savings go down, I figured, why not double-down on Bitcoin? Worst case was me being in the same place I was year back . 
Fast forward to mid-2021: I’d scraped together about $12,000 through freelance and sold off a handful of collectibles to DCA more aggressively. Didn’t tell a soul( my bestfriend and I felt embarrassed for 'betting the farm' . My partner thought I was gambling away our future. But every green candle felt like some sorta hope…
Then came the collapses: LUNA implosion (around May 2022), exchange hacks, the full-on crypto winter of 2022. 
I hovered by my screen at odd hours sitting between friends , family gatherings ,,,,every time price dipped below my entry  I lost sleep.Even though I had backup of my job at that point. 
Somehow, by Q1 2025, that $12k had snowballed into $130,000 . I know, it sounds impossible like one of those late-night infomercials, or general youtube shorts stories but here we are. And now I’m staring at my balance, wondering if I should pull the trigger and secure my future, or sit tight because the next halving could break all records.I’m exhausted. 
The stress of watching every headline interest rate hikes, geopolitical flashpoints, inflation reports has turned me into a jittery wreck. I catch myself refreshing the chart at 3 AM. My partner tells me I need a break, that money’s not worth my peace of mind. But the thought of walking away before the next bull run scares me more than missing out.
So here’s where I’m at: I’m eyeing a 50% exit. Enough to clear debts, stash some into a small down payment fund, and take a few trips I’ve planned with my partner. The rest stays locked in fortified cold storage, because if we’re not hodling, what’s the point?
I don’t know if this is capitulation or a pragmatic win. Maybe I’m not that gutsy. but it’s okay at the end now that I’m writing this post remembering it all .

Not BTC though. It's got zero revenue. 

You have to sell it to realise any gains and then you're faced with the FOMO of the price going higher. It's the perfect ponzi (if it was meant to be one, which it isn't, it just has sorta ended up looking a bit like one).

If you can't bear to sell some, then at least try to bridge some to take advantage of the yield which is currently out there. cbBTC has incentives on most chains, Solana is probably the best ATM. There's a number of others around too like tBTC, some other sBTC based versions on Solana. 

Core, Babylon, Stacks etc... all have incentives for bridging into their wrapped versions. 

A Blocmates Orange (blocmates) and Supply Shock (Blockworks) are two good podcasts to get started understanding what's out there in the, still early, BTC defi space.

OneKey Classic 1S Teaser,"*coinbase* is a generic term referring to the first transaction in a bitcoin block. 

So from the genesis block of bitcoin until now, in the bitocoin protocol, miners are allowed to claim new coins (as MEV subsity) in each block, using the outputs of the first transaction in that block. Because the first transactioncan is special because it originates coins and can accumulates fees from the entire block, it's called the [""coinbase transaction""](https://documentation.cash/protocol/blockchain/block.html#coinbase-transaction).

To keep miners from mining malicious blocks then cashing out on a bad chain, there is a lockup period (of 100 blocks I belive).

So when someone says ""Oh no, all my money is locked in coinbase"" it means most of their cash is from bitcoin and transaction fees mined in the last eight (8) hours. 

When someone says ""I sent it from coinbase"", what that means is they waited long enough to spend their mined transactoin.

***

Very expensive white-shoe fascist lawyers will try to say that ""coinbase"" is a trademark for a company. And a dumbfuck nazi judge might agree.

"If a nation state secretly cracked Bitcoin’s cryptography, what could we even do ?","I can’t shake this worry ,,,what if the entire U.S. financial system gets tethered so tightly to BTC that a single coordinated regulator action could blackball it overnight?
Last year the SEC finally greenlit multiple spot ETFs people cheered n all  yet here we are, depending on a handful of gatekeepers who could just as easily pull the plug. Imagine 
When black-swan legislation hits, they order all U.S.-based custodians to halt withdrawals “for national security,” freeze addresses, or demand backdoors in wallet software. One morning you wake up, log into your  exchange or custodian, and your sats are locked behind a legal injunction. All because Bitcoin became “too systemic” to ignore.
We’ve always bragged that nobody can censor or freeze our coins yet right now, hundreds of billions of dollars in BTC are parked in institutions that answer to Congress (even if only 15% of total supply is custodieed there),, 
 I just want to know if anyone else has run through this scenario: how does a truly decentralized network survive when such a critical mass of its tradable value sits under custodial agreements? Do we bolt for hardware wallets and split our stash across fifty jurisdictions? Or is there some stealth move like privacy tech to dilute KYC taint (CoinSwap, Whirlpool) that we haven’t even dreamed up yet?

Edit: Also, while you’re shuffling coins off custody and worrying about KYC chains, don’t forget tax compliance doesn’t take a holiday. I’ve started using Awaken.Tax quietly in the background it tracks all my on chain moves (even the tricky DeFi jumps) without me scouring CSVs for days.

BTC holders getting this letter from the IRS? (Don't panic),"The other week, I got a letter from the IRS in the mail about my Bitcoin activity (Letter 6174) and I panicked way more than I should have. For a second, I was genuinely afraid I was at risk of an audit.

I was panicking, but I was also frustrated. I had to sell some of my sats to pay for some personal expenses last year. I have been trying my best to report taxes, even using CoinLedger to be prepped for the October extension deadline. Like wtf else does the IRS want me to do? Why am I getting a warning letter when I'm doing everything I can to stay compliant? 

Turns out it wasn’t just me. I posted on a tax sub and a bunch of other investors said they received it too  — even some who’ve only HODLed and never sold.

The theory some commenters said is that these letters are going to anyone the IRS knows holds BTC via 1099s from exchanges like Coinbase (maybe a fishing technique to get people who sold a significant amount to self-report?)

Anyway, just sharing this to keep people informed. Hopefully, no one freaks out the way I did.

**TL;DR:** IRS is sending Letter 6174 to BTC holders — not necessarily a sign of an audit. Don’t freak out.

It's an intimidation tactic. I've actually reported my crypto transactions on my taxes, so they can fuck right off.

remember this post, zcash will replace bitcoin in the not too distant future. privacy is a real thing, and with bitcoin, nothing is private. nations, corporations, big players will covet the privacy zcash offers in such a hard currency (zcash is literally bitcoin but upgraded)

**The Elephant in Ring that is Cloaked by Privacy**

The ring of course is the Bitcoin fight over security, blocksize and scaling. The Elephant in the Ring has solved the problem by combining elements from all three:

1) The tail emission has money supply growth below that of gold thereby being inflation free. The tail emission is also high enough to provide proven POW security. This is very close to the sweet point

2) It has a smaller effective blocksize than all the three above, before pricing starts, This minimizes spam risk,

3) It has a an adaptive blocksize powered by more than one median. This allows for future growth to greater than VISA transaction rates on layer 1, with very low fees. It scales way better today on layer 1, than BankAmericard, the precursor to VISA, did on its launch in 1959.

What happenes when Bitcoin wins and Fiat collapses?,"Post got removed on r/Bitcoin :(


If Fiat completely dies due to eventual hyperinflation, what will happen to those who don't own Bitcoin or sats? To all the other 7.8 or so billion people?

Will all the governments start enforcing cold wallets? Or will everyone now have to use phones or cards? Even the people on very rural areas? How will all the other people perform transactions if there can only be about 30k transactions every 10 minutes? Or will everyone use the lighting network solutions? And will they also be decentralized, or owned by few people? And if so, wont they become just like central banks of today, controlled by a few groups of powerful people, efffectively changing nothing?

If there will only be 21 million Bitcoin, or 2.1 quadrillion satoshi, will those who bought early become the rothschilds of future and the other 7.8 billion people can fuck off? Wont this create an even greater weath inequality, or is that the aim for most Bitcoin investors? To become the new aristocrat class of the future? Or are most hoping to sell off some sats for millions of Fiat in the future?

Also, won't it be detrimental to the current world leaders, secret families, governemts and so on, to let Fiat die and give up their control? Or are they planning to take control via other methods by allowing Bitcoin to become the new world currency? 

How will wages, salaries work in a deflation? If Bitcoin amount won't ever increase, and sometimes decrease due to people losing their keys, will people have to give up their sats for services with no way to get more sats in the future? Or will sat price on good and services continue to decrease indefinetly? How will infrastructure, energy, public roads, education, military etc be funded? Will people be taxed in sats? How will all this be enforced?

Or will other crypto be used for exchange of goods and services, and Bitcoin will be a store of Value?

What happenes when Bitcoin wins and Fiat collapses?,"You have a lot of assumptions in your question... it's really not a question you're asking rather it seems you're postulating what you think might happen.

The truth, regardless of how smart one is, is that no one knows.  These are uncharted waters.

At any rate, to answer some of your questions, I think a few of your assumptions are off-base.  For example, you ask about wealth inequality and Bitcoin's seemingly inability to solve it.  I would say Bitcoin was never meant to solve wealth inequality, those who do better should have more.  But what Bitcoin does solve is central banks being the source of power, and by extension a small group of people.  Even if the rich own all the Bitcoin, the protocol itself still answers to the underlying programming.  So it doesn't solve wealth inequality but it does level the playing field by taking the control of the money supply out of the hands of a small group of individuals.  And just that, with the onchain transparency it provides and the transparent BIP updates that everyone can see on GitHub, that's a big advancement.

On your question about the existing power structure of the world, the beauty of decentralized protocols is that they don't have the power to eliminate it, or at least have so far been unsuccessful.  

On your deflation question, it's a very interesting experiment.  On one hand, economics has shown a inflationary currency leads to the most economic productivity.  If said economy also uses debt, then the productivity increase even more.  Said differently, when the population cannot maintain and store the value of their labor over long periods of time, it forces them to keep working.  And when more work is done, the more goods and services we have.  So debt and inflationary currencies are good.  In this sense, Bitcoin would be bad.

On the other hand, throughout history, no inflationary currency has survived any meaningful period of time.  Think about it, what currency can you name that's been around for 100 years?  Very few, the US dollar, which today is a ""Federal Reserve Note"" is different from when individual banks used to issue dollars and before that silver certificates, etc.  The Euro is new, the RMB is new, Argentina has had 3 currencies just in the span of a couple of decades.  There's probably a good reason Islam over thousands of years views interest rates as haram.  That mechanism by definition makes a system unsustainable.  So maybe if we had a perfect deflationary currency, it could be sustainable much longer than any inflationary currency.  In this way, Bitcoin is good.

So I guess what I'm saying is, no one knows.  But what I see is that the current monetary system (primarily the reliance on the US Dollar, which we even call the US interest rate the ""risk free rate"") is being challenged due to decades of fiscal irresponsibility, a few monetary policy blunders (during COVID for example), geopolitical weaponization (sanctions on Russia), and I think the risk and effects of a black swan that the world becomes multipolar rather than unipolar around the petrodollar are not fully priced in.

BTC Setup Too Clean to Ignore — Demand Zone Loaded 💥,"Rising Channel: Price is respecting an ascending channel.

Support Zone: The yellow circle highlights a key demand area with previous bounce zones.

Current Price: Testing lower channel support and hovering just above 109,385.

Resistance: Around 109,750 (horizontal zone + previous rejections).

Target Zone: Projected move toward 110,494, aligned with the upper channel and previous highs.

✅ Bullish Trade Idea:
Bias: Buy setup forming from channel support.

Entry Zone: Around 109,300–109,400, after confirming support in the yellow circle.

Stop-Loss: Below 108,750 (key structural support).

TP1: 109,750 (range resistance)

TP2: 110,494 (previous high & top of the channel)

Losing my mind over Ethereum tax nightmare!,"I need to know I’m not alone here just burned my entire weekend wrestling with Ethereum tax reporting. I always thought using the OG smart contract chain would be simpler, but holy hell, it’s a different . I’m not even a hardcore whale, but between swapping dozens of tokens on Uniswap and Sushiswap, locking and farming on Yearn and Aave, minting NFTs on OpenSea, and ETH via Lido and my own validator, my transaction count might as well be NASA-level.
I fed everything into my usual tax software (looking at you, TurboTax and Koinly), and it either skipped half my swaps, categorized multi-step vault deposits as “simple transfers,” or completely ignored my NFT royalties. Now I’m manually untangling ETH → USDC → WBTC → ETH loops that each triggered taxable events—even when I lost $50 on slippage.
On staking rewards: Those 100% count as ordinary income the second they’re minted, based on ETH’s price at that exact block. Then when you sell later, it’s another taxable event with a new cost basis. Getting taxed twice on the same coins feels criminal. How on earth are you supposed to track cost basis when you’re averaging 12 DeFi interactions daily across 8 waplets ?

When the market becomes hard to read, liquidity constantly shifts, but inevitably flows back into Bitcoin. Not just as the dominant asset, but as a benchmark. In times of fast movement, any strategy that ignores BTC in favor of purely speculative plays becomes increasingly hard to sustain mid-term.

In the part of my portfolio where I test newer or lower exposure tokens, I've started working with more structure. Fast and clean execution has become essential, especially when navigating chains with different transaction rules. A few tools have helped streamline this process, including BananaGun, which I occasionally use to evaluate trading conditions before entering a project.

It's just sad, because in 2016-2017 miners folded to centralized Core, resulting in Bitcoin falling far short of its potential.

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5usmko/the_hong_kong_agreement_that_has_totally_been/

The originator of ""Knots"", Luke-jr, was one of the Core developer signatories of the Hong Kong agreement, and tasked with developing a block size increase hard fork, which he dragged out and eventually proposed an initial lowering of the blocksize (as an insult-to-injury response to the miners who were facing a congested network with big companies like Steam dropping BTC adoption).

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/69w74o/just_a_reminder_about_the_text_of_the_hong_kong/

^(Personally I would also recommend all current BTC node runners migrate to Knots because that's the fastest way you're going to get rid of all that ""spam"" and reduce the blocksize on Bitcoin to, e.g. 300KB. /s)
