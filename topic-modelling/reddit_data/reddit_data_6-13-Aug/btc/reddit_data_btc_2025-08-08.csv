Just how much energy does bitcoin mining use?,"Yes everything uses energy but bitcoin uses more energy per transaction than banking by a long shot 

Your data is also wrong. Banking uses less than 300 TWH per year while bitcoin uses more than 150TWH per year

Banking worldwide (including branches, ATMs, networks etc) is about 260TWH per year 

Visa alone has an average TPS of 1700 so if that used all of the 260TWH, that's just over 1kwh per transaction which is 700 times less than bitcoin and that's just one payment processor.

this btc chart pattern looks exactly like before the 70k to 108k moonshot,"been staring at the charts all morning and stumbled across some analysis that's got me pretty bullish. trader galaxy just dropped some comparison charts showing btc is literally copying the same pattern that led to those massive gains in late 2024.

remember that run from 70k to 108k? apparently we're sitting in almost the exact same spot right now. btc is doing this support retest thing where it broke through a trendline and now it's coming back to test that line as support. last time this happened, price discovery mode kicked in and we rocketed straight up.

galaxy posted on twitter saying ""last time it looked like this it was before the run from 70k to 100k."" the setup is almost identical - btc breaks resistance, pulls back to retest it as support, then if it holds we get liftoff.

now obviously it's not a perfect copy. this time the trendline is ascending instead of descending, and we've got all this macro stuff with trade tariffs messing with risk assets. but the structure is remarkably similar.

what's really interesting is the swing low pattern galaxy spotted. we hit swing lows in april and june, and both times those levels held as the bottom - never got revisited. friday we briefly dipped below 112k for another swing low. if history repeats, that might be our floor.

another thing - analysts are saying btc probably won't repeat that nasty 30% dump we saw after hitting aths earlier this year. instead they're looking at that 109.3k january peak as ultimate support. so even if we do go lower, we're not talking about a major crash.

honestly this whole sideways action we've been in feels like accumulation before the next leg up. reduced volatility, consolidation around these levels, institutions still buying the dip. classic btc behavior before it decides to move violently in one direction.

if we do get another major run like the 70k to 108k move, anyone actively trading these swings should probably start thinking about tax implications early. tracking cost basis and timing becomes way more important when you're looking at potential 50%+ gains, especially with all the talk about possible capital gains changes. tools like awaken.tax can help keep everything organized before things get crazy again.

the consensus seems to be that btc is going to pick a direction soon after weeks of this boring price action. if this pattern comparison holds up, that direction might be straight up.

what do you guys think? are you seeing the same similarities in the charts? or is this just hopium disguised as technical analysis?

personally i'm keeping my dca going and watching that support level closely. if it holds and we start pushing higher, this could be the setup for another 50% run.",False,0,

🧵 Bitcoin Chain Selection: Who Wins in a Fork?,"Ever wonder how Bitcoin picks the “real” chain when there’s a split?
It doesn’t count blocks. It picks the chain with the most proof of work.

Let’s say there’s a fork:
Chain A adds 1 block at the old, tougher difficulty.
Chain B adds 2 blocks, but after a difficulty drop.
Which one wins?

Not the longer one. The heavier one.

Bitcoin adjusts mining difficulty every ~2 weeks to keep block times around 10 minutes.
If blocks are coming in too slow, the difficulty drops. That makes mining easier.

Say the difficulty falls by a third.
Now 1 old-difficulty block = 3 units of work.
Each new-difficulty block = 1 unit of work.

So:
Chain A = 1 × 3 = 3 units
Chain B = 2 × 1 = 2 units

Even though it’s shorter, Chain A wins. More work = more weight.

Bitcoin doesn’t care about who got there first or who added more blocks.
It cares who did more work. That’s the chain the network follows.

You can’t bluff your way to consensus.
You’ve gotta put in the hash 💪

🧵 Bitcoin Chain Selection: Who Wins in a Fork?,"> Ever wonder how Bitcoin picks the “real” chain when there’s a split?
> It doesn’t count blocks. It picks the chain with the most proof of work.

That's only partly correct and highly depends on what you mean by fork.


For example if there are two blocks mined at the same time they compete for the being the actual chain and chain header. Some other miner will find a block on top of one of them and all miners will realign themselves onto the new ""most work"" blockchain header. In this case you are correct. This works because all the miners follow the same ruleset. 


In the other case where there is a chain split, two rulesets exists for the creation of the next block and nakamoto consensus cannot tell you which ruleset is the ""right"" one. Miners have to choose which ruleset they follow and support with their hash and people have to decide which ruleset is ""their"" chain. 

In case of the BCH/BTC split, people were let to believe that hashrate is all that matters and that let to false believes like yours. But there are a multitude of things that one needs to consider. Imagine BTC split into BTC and NEWBTC and the old BTC implemented tail emission. Since it pays miners more its hashrate would be greater but would you consider it Bitcoin? 

In the end most people picked the most easy way out and choose by branding, which was unfortunately also assigned by the capturers before the split and not after.",True,4,🎓 Education

Decentralize or Die: A Manifesto Against Government Interference in Crypto,"The problem of people not seeing a problem when governments want to be part of the crypto world worries me. These guys are crooks and destroy everything good that is for the people, all in the name of pursuing their taxes and making people work for them like slaves just to survive.

Governments don't produce anything — they use people to bag more money for their roles.

When they show interest in crypto, trust me, something is wrong. They can’t destroy it, so what they do is worse. They associate with corporations to buy it up, or use organizations to seize it — all in the name of “acceptance,” while in truth, what they want is more control. They want to monitor how and when it's used so they can charge what they claim belongs to them.

We aren't safe anymore, and the ones who are happy about the U.S. entering the crypto scenario are so blind — believing in politicians is like taking a rope and putting it around your own neck.

Imagine 100,000 users each day start using some form of Bitcoin, and each of those makes ten transactions every day from the day they are onboarded.

After one year, that means 365,000,000 million transactions per day. Bitcoin Cash obviously can't support that, especially as they refuse to put Lightning on top of their Bitcoin Cash chain. **Bitcoin Cash would crash and burn within days of trying to onboard these users**.

Bitcoin _with Lightning_ solves this. It takes only one on-chain transaction, typically costing about $1, to onboard the user. After they are onboarded, they can make essentially unlimited transactions

Lightning transactions are instant. And they are instantly confirmed; i.e. they are fully ""trustless"". Lightning balances are _not_ IOUs. You can always move your Lightning balance onto the chain _even if nobody else cooperates and if they try to steal your funds_

By contrast, it takes roughly ten minutes (at the least) to have any confidence that a Bitcoin Cash transaction has completed

In short, the BCH has had 8 years to deploy Lightning, or some suitable alternative if they think they can do better, to deliver huge numbers of instant, trustless, transactions. But they haven't even tried

Nobody, not even the most hardcore big-blocker BCH fanboy, really thinks that making that blocks 32 times bigger - or even a thousand times bigger - would deliver the super-high rate of instant trustless transactions that we get with Lightning",True,-2,

The Math of Cracking Missing Seed Words,"I recently released a new free and Creative Commons licensed [tutorial](https://youtu.be/R9IP5dLghzA) on the math of cracking missing seed words. I created a tool for calculating the number of missing bits, possible combinations, and estimated cracking times for pros and consumers.

One of the interesting things that I found is that the last word being included in the missing words makes a decent difference in the overall combinations and crack times for up to around 3 missing words, since the 4 to 8 checksum bits aren't included in the cracking operations.

TL;DR for about 1-3 missing words, cracking/recovering is possible and fairly likely. Once you get to 4-5 words, it becomes impractical or impossible. Anything above 6 and definitely a full seed is impossible.

These are [tables](https://imgur.com/a/3LF7fC3) I generated using my [code](https://github.com/chaintuts/seedwordsmith) to show the viability of cracking a certain amount of words, with and without the last word included.",False,4,🎓 Education
indonesia might add bitcoin to reserves and it’s hitting my mindset,"i’ve been following the crypto space for years and even i’m a bit stunned that indonesia’s vice president office is exploring bitcoin as a national reserve asset. they met with Bitcoin Indonesia, pitched mining using their hydro and geothermal power, and even mentioned allocating around $18 billion to btc holdings

they also talked about education initiatives and long term value...citing forecasts like $13 million per bitcoin by 2045

i’m honestly conflicted. part of me feels proud, this could legitimize bitcoin at a national level like no other. but another part of me is cautious, they still ban crypto payments, enforcement is inconsistent, and taxes on trading and mining have doubled recently

here’s what i keep thinking:

a government seriously considering btc for reserves isn’t hype. it's strategic.

indonesia has massive renewable energy...mining makes sense on paper.

but the math still scares me...$18b equals roughly 200 000 btc. that’s serious exposure.

i can’t afford to get too excited because there's still risk. policy can flip. enforcement might tighten. or the public education push could fall flat.

yet if it happens..if indonesia pushes forward, it might shift the sentiment globally. could trigger other nations to rethink reserve strategy. could boost btc just by signaling long term institutional trust.

from where i sit i’m holding. i might average in more if this escalates into actual policy. worst case it fizzles, btc stays sideways, taxes stay high, and regulations stay tight. best case indonesia opens the floodgates. btw make sure you're tracking everything properly for taxes been using awaken.tax to keep all my staking rewards and trades organized",False,2,⌨ Discussion

> [early 2025 just proved why bitcoin's security model is superior](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1mir0lz/bros_keep_telling_me_to_switch_from_btc_but_early/)

My ask:

__Can you explain the ""security model"" you are talking about?__

So that we the arguments people make in favor of it can be properly evaluated. Fiat is not going to be replaced by something which can't at least properly argue for its future security and ability to replace whatever part of the existing financial system it is intended to replace.",False,4,⌨ Discussion
"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.","Fun Facts:

BTC, BSV or BCH security models are largely equivalent.   
  
By design, Bitcoins security model scales to:

1. The number of network participants using the network (aka Metcalfe's law) is instrumental in security.
2. Bitcoin's security subsidy shrinks over time to marginal cost to secure the network from point 1. above.
3. While the security subsidy depletes over time, security is transitioned to secure the average value transacted on the network.  **IE.** as the miners are paid to secure the network without subsidized security, they are dependent on transaction fees. Because transacting is optional and not guaranteed, miners in a free market are expected to encourage and optimize for high-volume and maximum revenue, aka economies of scale that are dependent on the network and network effect from point 1.
4. A tangent security benefit is safety in large numbers or the Oddity Effect, obfuscation the networks transactions leaving governments with the only option to follow the money when a crime is committed as opposed to blanket KYC legislation that moots privacy linking identity to transactions, in an age where AI can track everything. again point 1 the larger the number of transactions the greater the network effect the more secure the network is.

Both BCH and BTC for the most part retain these design features and are 100% equivalent.  
**The bottom line**, security of most forks of the Bitcoin ledger is equivalent and proportional to the perceived value of the token.

While BTC has a greater network effect, it is limited in transaction capacity, allowing KYC touchpoints with trusted third parties to link the majority of transactions with participants identity. Ultimately leaving BTC with an inferior security model to BCH.

TL;DR: token price relative to network effect = security.",True,7,⌨ Discussion
"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.",">**Can you explain the ""security model"" you are talking about?**

Security is a complex issue. It is foolish to restrict it to just a subset of the important properties. Some of the known and discussed BTC security issues:

* Security in the sense of certainty that transactions will be registered in the blockchain.
   * This has already become an issue, since there are more transactions coming than the network can store in the blockchain. BTC's ""security solution"" is to ignore the transactions that exceed the network limit. This is not really secure and it will exacerbate other issues.
* Security in the sense of certainty that an attacker will be unable to find the signature for some UTXO's he does not own.
   * It is well known (an algorithm has already been written) how to brute-force a signature for some coins provided one owns a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. The only obstacle is, that the existing quantum computers are not powerful enough.
   * When sufficiently powerful quantum computers will be developed, the only secure solution will be to switch to quantum-resistant signatures. This will have several security implications
      * It is known that a quantum-resistant signature will require a multiple of data sufficient for its quantum-unsecure counterpart. This will negatively affect the transaction throughput, lowering the likelihood that a transaction will be registered in the blockchain.
      * All UTXO's will have to be transformed from the existing quantum-unsecure form to a form using a quantum-resistant signature. This transformation will be a very demanding operation requiring billions of quantum-secure transactions to be registered in short time, which, as we know, the BTC network is not secure to do.",True,2,⌨ Discussion

In essence, it will never get too easy where there will be way too many miners and never too hard where only a few thousand could profit. 

The main argument though for hackers or state organizations trying to take over miners is essentially multiple governments all over the world would have to have a coordinated take over the majority of miners which if ever successful would make the value of bitcoin zero.

After that, not too sure. My wife might want to open a coffee shop or bakery. I volunteer a couple of times a week and work on art projects. But the primary focus is being super present for our son.

bros keep telling me to switch from btc but early 2025 just proved why bitcoin's security model is superior,"been seeing a lot of posts lately about moving from bitcoin to eth for ""higher returns"" but honestly the recent events have me more convinced than ever that bitcoin's approach is the right one

yeah ethereum might pump harder sometimes but look what happened in early 2025 - billions got drained in that massive hack. meanwhile bitcoin's network just keeps chugging along like it has for 15+ years without a single successful direct attack on the protocol itself

the complexity argument is real. ethereum's got all these smart contracts and defi protocols creating endless attack vectors. every new feature is another potential way for someone to find an exploit and drain funds. bitcoin keeps it simple - peer to peer electronic cash, nothing fancy, nothing that can blow up in your face

and don't get me started on the regulatory stuff. sure ethereum got some wins with things like the genius act, but all that defi integration means way more regulatory surface area. one bad policy decision and the whole ecosystem could get hammered. bitcoin's just digital money - harder for governments to mess with without looking completely authoritarian

look i get it, ethereum has its place and the tech is impressive. but when people say ""move from bitcoin to eth for gains"" they're basically saying ""give up the most secure, battle-tested network for something flashier""

the tax implications alone make this tricky - switching between assets creates taxable events that tools like awaken.tax help track, but you're still dealing with complexity that hodling bitcoin avoids entirely

not saying ethereum is going to zero or anything, but calling bitcoin ""outdated"" while ethereum is getting billions stolen feels pretty backwards to me

"why bitcoin is the first choice for institutional treasuries, according to the numbers that actually matter","been thinking about what makes bitcoin the obvious pick for serious institutional money after seeing all these corporate treasury adoptions accelerate. the data tells a pretty clear story about why companies choose btc over everything else when they want to store real value.

the track record speaks for itself: bitcoin has been running for 16+ years without a single day of downtime. no rollbacks, no emergency shutdowns, no ""we need to pause the network"" moments. when microstrategy puts $42 billion into btc, they're betting on that reliability continuing forever.

the security model is unmatched: over $2 trillion in market cap secured by the most robust proof of work network ever built. hundreds of thousands of miners across every continent making it literally impossible to attack or control. institutions understand that this isn't just marketing, it's mathematical certainty.

no counterparty risk: when tesla buys bitcoin, they're not trusting any company, foundation, or development team to keep their money safe. they're trusting pure mathematics and thermodynamics. no single point of failure, no ceo that can change the rules, no governance token that can vote to confiscate funds.

the adoption metrics are wild:

$150+ billion in corporate treasuries (microstrategy, tesla, mara, etc)

spot etfs holding over $100 billion in just the first year

entire countries using it as legal tender

pension funds and insurance companies allocating billions

what institutions actually care about: forget smart contracts and defi yields. corporations want digital gold that can't be debased, confiscated, or controlled by any government or entity. bitcoin delivers exactly that and nothing else comes close to the same level of certainty.

the network effects are accelerating: every major bank now offers bitcoin services. payment processors integrate btc by default. accounting firms understand how to handle it. the infrastructure exists for institutions to buy, hold, and use bitcoin without technical complexity. tools like awaken.tax are becoming standard for proper treasury management and compliance tracking.

monetary policy you can audit: 21 million bitcoin, period. no inflation beyond the predetermined schedule that ends in 2140. institutions can literally verify the entire monetary policy by running the code. try doing that with any fiat currency or alternative crypto.

why this matters going forward: we're watching the transition from ""bitcoin is risky speculation"" to ""bitcoin is essential treasury infrastructure."" once institutions realize they can store value in something that can't be printed, debased, or controlled, the adoption becomes inevitable.

the numbers don't lie. corporate treasuries are voting with billions of dollars and they're choosing bitcoin over everything else for long term value storage. that tells you everything about where this is heading.

anyone else seeing this institutional adoption accelerate faster than expected? or are we still early enough that most companies haven't figured out they need bitcoin exposure yet?",False,0,

Well, alright. Would you care to demonstrate how a sufficient Security Budget could be maintained going forward ?

Have you ever seen anyone demonstrate same?

What is your estimate for a Security Budget, in say, 10-15 years.  Sufficient to pay for enough mining activity to keep the chain secure ?

Would you agree… say $20 to $30 Million per day ?  Perhaps $10 B per year. 
(Just a bit lower than now.)
What if coin price continues to rise ??

Or would you prefer to base an estimate on percentage of Market Cap ?  
I’ve asked many Bitcoiners. Several hardcore ones have suggested between 1 to 2%  of Market Cap annually. 

Personally I think that’s overkill. I think about 1% of Market Cap should be lots. But as low as 0.5% may suffice.

1. Do nothing, really. Bitcoin is already perfect, so why bother? Stack sats and wait for the day you’re a fiat billionaire. 

2. Post some price charts, make bold predictions about flipping gold by next year. 

3. Troll the skeptics to death, even if they’re right. Don’t admit any flaw – when in doubt, refer to commandment one. 

4. Slay your idols. Well, except for the high priests who get a free pass for shitcoining. They are cool, at least until Mr. Hodl or Giacomo tells you that they’re not. 

5. Anyone who uses the Bitcoin codebase to build anything without the blessing of Blockstream is a shitcoiner who deserves to get slain. 

6. Liquid is a sidechain and Lightning is the one true way to scale Bitcoin. Anyone claiming otherwise is a shitcoiner who deserves to get slain. 

7. Ethereum is a bigger enemy than bankers, politicians & spooks infiltrated within the community. Make fun of Ethereum at least 3 times a week, then praise JP Morgan, the Trump family and BlackRock for being such bitcoin bulls. If you discover that they buy ethereum too, refer to commandment no. 4!

8. The community is decentralized and diverse, so nobody speaks for Bitcoin except for Greg Maxwell and 3 other guys who can effectively shut down initiatives to improve the project. You think Bitcoin needs improvements? Refer to commandment no. 1!

9. If you came to Bitcoin in 2017 or later, you’re a pleb and you will always be a pleb. Be happy about it pleb, embrace the name and never question your OG overlords. 

10. It is always better to be a pleb who posts memes and “mines fiat”. What do you mean you want Bitcoin to scale to 8 billion people? Don’t you like custodial lightning? Refer to commandment no. 1 and repent, or else you’re a shitcoiner.

david bailey wants to raise $200m pac to push bitcoin to $10 million and abolish capital gains tax on btc sales,"david bailey just announced plans to raise a $100m to $200m political action committee focused entirely on advancing bitcoin interests in the us. this is the same guy who advised trump on bitcoin policy and basically orchestrated the entire political pivot that got us a pro crypto administration.

the scope of this pac is massive: bailey wants to anchor it through nakamoto holdings, his $300 million bitcoin treasury company. but the goals he outlined are way more ambitious than typical crypto lobbying. we're talking about fundamentally changing how america treats bitcoin.

primary objectives include:

pushing bitcoin price to $10 million (yes, he actually said this)

positioning bitcoin for long term dominance

abolishing capital gains tax on bitcoin sales

protecting self custody rights

legal protections for open source bitcoin developers

community suggestions are getting wild: stephan livera wants complete elimination of capital gains on btc. alex gladstein from human rights foundation is pushing for bitcoin debt payments from foreign countries, high school bitcoin education funding, and developer protection laws.

tuur demeester went even further, calling for full reserve banking requirements where banks must hold 100% of customer deposits in reserve. that would basically end fractional reserve banking as we know it.

this is different from previous crypto lobbying: fairshake pac spent $130 million in 2024 elections but focused on general crypto friendly candidates. bailey's pac would be bitcoin specific and aims to reshape fundamental economic policy around btc.

the fact that someone with direct trump administration connections is talking about $10 million bitcoin targets through political action tells you how seriously they're taking bitcoin's role in future policy.

potential concerns: charles allen from btcs warned bailey about fiduciary duty issues since he's using public company resources for political efforts. there's a real legal risk if shareholders think corporate funds are being misused for political activism.

bailey's response was that coinbase backed fairshake without issues, but allen pointed out that might not make sense in a pro crypto environment where corporate political spending isn't necessary.

the bigger picture: crypto companies spent $134 million on 2024 elections and won big. now we have elected officials who are actually pro bitcoin instead of just tolerating crypto. bailey sees this as the moment to push for structural changes while we have political momentum.

fairshake still has $141 million ready for future elections, but bailey's pac would be laser focused on bitcoin specific policy changes rather than general crypto acceptance.

what this could mean: if bailey successfully raises $200m and focuses it entirely on bitcoin policy priorities, we could see actual legislation around capital gains elimination, self custody protection, and bitcoin reserve banking requirements.

the $10 million price target isn't just speculation anymore when someone with this level of political access is building a war chest specifically to make it happen through policy changes. with tax implications changing this dramatically, tools like awaken.tax are going to become essential for tracking everything properly.

anyone else thinking this might be the moment when bitcoin transitions from alternative asset to actual monetary policy tool?",False,2,📰 News

this fibonacci model has called every bitcoin move since $15k and says $166k is next...the math is actually scary accurate,"been diving into this fibonacci analysis from cryptocon and honestly, the pattern recognition is wild. this guy has been tracking btc since the ftx bottom at $15.5k and every major move has hit fibonacci extensions almost perfectly.

here's how it's played out since 2022:

$15,500 (cycle bottom after ftx collapse)

$30,362 (1.618 fib extension) - hit in april 2023, consolidation

$46,831 (2.618 extension) - hit january 2024, became support

$71,591 (3.618 extension) - touched march/june 2024, rejected twice

$109,236 (4.618 extension) - broken january 2025

next target: $166,754 (5.618 extension)

the spacing between these levels has been incredibly consistent. each leg up was around 52-54% gains before consolidation. we're currently sitting around $114k, which puts us in the transition zone between 4.618 and 5.618.

this isn't just technical hopium either:
every previous bitcoin cycle topped near specific fibonacci levels. 2013 peaked at the 5.618 extension around $1,150. 2017 hit just past 4.618 near $20k. even 2021's ""irregular"" cycle topped at $69k, which was almost exactly the 3.618 extension from 2018 lows.

the fundamental backdrop supports it:

post-halving dynamics still playing out (we're 16 months in)

etfs now hold $150b in assets (6.5% of total btc market cap)

regulatory clarity improving with genius act passing

strategic bitcoin reserve pilot program approved

but there are warning signs:
benjamin cowen points out that every post-halving year sees july/august gains followed by september corrections. we just had a 7.22% july gain, so if the pattern holds, we might see a pullback next month.

another analyst noted that profit-taking metrics are forming lower highs, suggesting each rally faces stronger selling pressure. we might get two more legs up before the cycle peaks.

what's interesting is the institutional component:
previous cycles were retail-driven. this one has blackrock holding 740k btc and institutions controlling 1 in every 15 bitcoin in circulation. that's a completely different market structure that could support higher prices.

the $166k target isn't some random moonshot number - it's where the math says we should go if this pattern continues. whether we get there in one shot or with corrections along the way is the real question.

the $112k dip might have been the best thing that happened to bitcoin... cause this setup looks too good to ignore,"just saw some interesting analysis about this weekend's btc dump to $112k and honestly, it might have been exactly what we needed. instead of freaking out about the selloff, let me break down why this could actually be setting up for a serious recovery.

the ""power of 3"" pattern is playing out perfectly: we've seen the classic accumulation phase ($119k-$115k), then manipulation (the dump to $112k), and now we might be entering distribution toward $126k. this isn't random, it's how institutional money operates while retail panics.

$922 million liquidation event cleared the deck: this was the biggest liquidation since february with $240m in btc futures alone. open interest dropped from $88b to $79b. when this much leverage gets flushed out, it removes the overhang that was keeping price suppressed.

funding rates flipped negative across exchanges: binance, bitmex, deribit all showing negative funding. that means shorts are paying longs to keep positions open. when retail is this bearish after a correction, it's usually time to start thinking contrarian.

binance taker volume hit -$1.5b: this level of aggressive selling hasn't been seen since july 25th. it's classic retail behavior - buy the top, sell the bottom. the panic selling around $114k was probably the capitulation we needed.

technical levels are lining up: the $112k-$115k zone was a major fair value gap that got filled. we bounced off the previous ath from may which is now acting as support. if we can reclaim $115.3k and $116.8k, $120k becomes a magnet with all that liquidation cluster sitting there.

why this feels different: previous corrections this cycle were about uncertainty. this one feels like a reset. leverage got flushed, weak hands got shaken out, and funding rates reset. the market structure actually looks healthier now than before the dump.

we're sitting around $114k right now but the signs are pointing toward a bounce. when you combine technical rebound signals with sentiment washing out and leverage being cleared, you get the setup for sustained moves higher.

not saying we're immediately going to $126k, but this correction might have done exactly what was needed to continue the bull market instead of ending it.

From CFDs to real Bitcoin,"Not sure if it’s for this sub, but here we go.

A few years back, I got into BTC through eToro, but only with CFDs.

I paid extra for that, but the returns have been great so I didn’t really care at the time.

Now I want to actually own my BTC. My plan is to sell the CFDs, withdraw to my bank, buy real BTC (only BTC) through an exchange, and then move it to my own wallet.

Timing is always a bit of a gamble, since I could end up selling during a local peak and buying back during a dip, or the other way around. I know there’s never a perfect moment, but I want to be in control and accept that risk.

A few things I’m still unsure about:

•	⁠Hardware wallet, or would you trust a good software wallet for long-term holding and why?
•	⁠For a EU resident, which exchange would you recommend for buying real BTC?
•	⁠Are there important things to keep in mind during this migration, like fees, taxes, timing, or risks that I might not be thinking of? For example, I’m aware that there are conversion costs when selling on eToro and moving funds to euro, plus their spread is pretty steep compared to most exchanges, and there are also network fees when sending BTC to my own wallet.
•	⁠Is there any reason not to go full self-custody, or any alternatives worth considering?

I’d really appreciate practical advice or experiences from people who have made this switch or expert in these matters. Obviously I will not answer to PM’s.

Thanks!",False,1,
From CFDs to real Bitcoin,"Get some coins and try all this stuff until you are comfortable with. For now fees are low so testing is cheap. To many people buy and transfer once and have no idea what they are doing and are super anxious about it. 

Hardware wallets are NEVER a secure storage. Electronic fails all the time. A Cold wallet in Paper or Metal is consideres safe. A Hardware wallets job is to bridge that gap when you want access to your coins.


While you are at it, also get some working Bitcoin: BCH for comparison. Works better and cheaper to test and wallet tech wise it is basically the same. Bonus: can still be transferred when BTC has another congestion.",True,3,

Balancing maxi brain with degen curiosity: how do you keep your BTC conviction while still poking around new-launch land?,"The sub is having another round of soul-searching about ""Bitcoin’s lost its way,"" institutional custody, KYC creep, you name it. I’m firmly in the self-custody, long-term-savings camp, but I’ll be honest: I still wander off-trail to scout fresh Sol/Base memes for fun money. The problem is information overload. If you scroll CT or DEX feeds for ten minutes, every new cartoon dog is ""the future of payments,"" and suddenly my hard-earned sats start to look… slow.

So I split my headspace into two lanes:

* Core stack: hardware wallet, no rehypothecation, DCA, ignore the price until the next halving.
* Curiosity sandbox: tiny allocation I can literally afford to round down to zero. For that I run a saved filter in BananaGun Pro that surfaces sub-five-minute launches so I can scratch the degen itch quickly, then rotate any winnings back into BTC cold storage.

Keeping the buckets separate has two nice side effects:

1. It reminds me how calm Bitcoin actually is, ten minutes in launch-chart hell makes one-block confirmations feel like a spa day.
2. When a meme goes 5x and I swap it into sats, it reinforces the ""BTC as base unit"" mindset instead of letting me spiral into unit bias.

Questions for the hive mind:

* Do you maintain a similar sandbox, or is it 100 % orange-pilled monk mode?
* How do you avoid the cynicism that creeps in when you watch altcoins pump 30 % in an hour while Bitcoin grinds in a $500 range?",False,3,

That’s your problem right there. Where do you get the idea that some meme token will become the future of payments. That’s just your FOMO throwing all rationality out.

⁠> Do you maintain a similar sandbox, or is it 100 % orange-pilled monk mode?

No, I’m interested in using Bitcoin as permission-less P2P cash, that’s what grabbed my attention.
I used to own BTC back when fees were always super low and it actually looked like it could be the future of payments.
As time went on Steam, Microsoft and a bunch of other high profile companies start experimenting with it but high fees and full blocks made 0-conf unreliable and transactions too expensive.

Balancing maxi brain with degen curiosity: how do you keep your BTC conviction while still poking around new-launch land?,"Because you think this shit is like what you see on TV and in movies… it’s not some high-stakes, eyes on charts thing. The real game is boring, and when you look at how the funds move it’s not in/out chasing pumps. Even those firms are chasing 10% yoy returns.

BTC has a stupid CAGR, which by low estimates is 30%… that means, if you put 25k into BTC on a 30 % CAGR, it’ll be worth over a million in 10 years, and closer to 2 million in like 12 years… if the CAGR cuts in half immediately even, it’d still be more than 30.

"btc hodlers are panic selling into binance at 7k btc per day while whales dump everything, this selloff is different","been watching the onchain data and this selloff is way nastier than the price action suggests. short-term holders just dumped 40k btc at a loss in 24 hours - that's the most panic selling since july 15th. meanwhile binance is seeing 7k btc inflows daily, up from 5.3k just a month ago.

here's what's actually happening:

the exchange whale ratio spiked above 0.70, meaning most of these deposits are coming from whales, not retail. when big money starts dumping this hard, especially on weekends when liquidity is thin, you know something's wrong.

august 1st alone saw 16,417 btc in net inflows to exchanges. that's not normal weekend flow - that's institutional money bailing out before monday.

the timing tells the whole story:

this started when btc first broke $110k in early july. since then, we've seen a steady increase in selling pressure that everyone ignored because price kept going up. but now the dam is breaking.

what's scary is this isn't just retail getting shaken out. the us bitcoin etfs had $812 million in outflows on august 1st - the second largest daily drawdown ever. institutional money is running for the exits alongside the whales.

analyst skew pointed out something interesting:

the weekend order book activity was ""not your average weekend price action."" large players were quoting massive size just to facilitate their exits without completely crashing the market. that takes serious money.

we're sitting at $114k right now but the flow data suggests this bounce is temporary. when you have 7k btc hitting binance daily and whales dominating the deposits, the path of least resistance is down.

the market structure has completely flipped since july. before that, inflows were declining for months - classic accumulation phase. now we're seeing the reverse as smart money distributed into retail fomo.

what's different this time:

institutional money is selling alongside whales

short-term holders are capitulating at losses

exchange flows show sustained selling pressure, not just volatility

weekend dumping suggests urgency, not planned profit-taking

this feels like the start of a deeper correction, not just a dip. when whales and institutions both head for the exits at the same time, retail usually gets left holding the bag.

Some advice. When you start keep your BTC on the exchange. The exchange account is safe enough for these amounts, and going full in with your own wallet has many risks in its own and any mistake with your own wallet risks you permanently losing your coins.

The exchange account is like a bank account. Quite well protected but in the hands of the exchange and not really your coins.

Having the coins in your own wallet is like withdrawing cash. You are fully responsible for managing the coins and no one will guard you from doing stupid things.

When you approach about 0.05 BTC then start looking into setting up your own wallet for long term use.

Until then take your time and learn more about what Bitcoin is. Set up a soft wallet on your mobile and one on your computer to play around with and learn the basics, but transfer only a very small amount there and let the rest stay on the exchange until you are ready to set up your real wallet.",True,1,

got my first paycheck last week and my coworkers are talking about their portfolios like they're financial wizards meanwhile im still figuring out how to set up a wallet without screwing something up

the timing feels weird though, like am i walking into a party that's already winding down or is this actually when smart money starts paying attention

thinking about just buying small amounts regularly instead of trying to time anything but then i see posts about people who bought years ago and wonder if that ship has sailed. when tax season rolls around, you might want to check out something like awaken.tax to help navigate the reporting requirements if you do start investing.

anyone else feel like they're constantly second guessing whether this is brilliant or completely insane

Past performance is no guarantee of future however. Just don't invest anything you won't need for at least 4yrs just in case. If you lack the conviction to hold through a potential 80% loss then Bitcoin isn't for you. Most folks lack the necessary diamond hands and end up selling into a dip only to watch it rise again. I'm not sure we'll see the traditional bear market drawdown or maybe just not as deep as previously or maybe that's a thing of the past. We'll see. Past patterns would indicate a top near Halloween   and a deep drawdown beginning about then. But Bitcoin is known to do the exact opposite of the most popular opinion too. The crypto and traditional stock markets are more human psychology than actual markets conditions. Sometimes it rises on bad news and dips on good news (buy the rumor and sell the news effect) but all that said I'm expecting it to be well about where it is now in 2030 even if does drop 80% in another crypto winter as previous. Lots of things are different this time (people always say that tho) but IMHO it's not just ETFs and nation states that make it different, Bitcoin hasn't ever seen the fiscal policies and interest rates before. I'm wondering if that's what has gimped it (still up from 17k at last bottom tho) and maybe we'll see interest rates coming down (nearly certain to happen in six weeks) and then maybe the money printer turns back on around that time which would be about when the 4yr cycle would normally end but it surprises everyone and rises hard.

"Arthur Hayes just dumped $13M in crypto and thinks BTC is heading back to $100k, here's why he might be right","Arthur Hayes dropped some serious FUD yesterday and honestly, his track record makes it worth paying attention to. The BitMEX founder just offloaded over $13 million worth of ETH, ENA, and PEPE, then warned that Bitcoin could retrace all the way back to $100k.

His reasoning? The macro picture is getting ugly fast.

July jobs report was absolute trash, only 73k new jobs when we needed way more

Credit growth is basically dead across major economies

GDP growth is stalling out everywhere you look

Tariff fears are ramping up again

Hayes isn't some random Twitter analyst either. When this guy moves $13M out of crypto positions and goes 81% cash (mostly USDC), you pay attention. His wallet now sits at $28.3M with $22.95M parked in stablecoins.

What a $100k Bitcoin would mean: That's an 18.7% correction from the $123k high we hit in July. Not exactly moon mission territory, but also not the end of the world. BTC has already dropped 7.7% from that peak, so we're partway there.

The interesting part is how divided people are on this. You've got Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas pointing out that Bitcoin volatility has been way more tame since the ETF approvals. Mitchell Askew from Blockware is saying the days of brutal bear markets are over.

But Hayes is looking at the bigger picture - when credit tightens and jobs disappear, risk assets get hammered. Doesn't matter if institutions are buying if the macro environment goes to shit.

My take: Hayes has been through multiple cycles and made bank timing these moves. If he's this bearish while sitting on a massive cash position, maybe it's time to at least consider that this bull run might need to take a breather.

The question isn't whether Bitcoin survives (it will), but whether we're about to see that classic macro-driven correction that reminds everyone crypto still moves with risk-on sentiment. Either way, gonna need awaken.tax working overtime if we're about to see some serious volatility and tax-loss harvesting opportunities.

Is buying prepaid eSIMs with Bitcoin a convenience win or fee trap?,"I’ve started experimenting with paying for travel data straight in BTC instead of messing with airport kiosks. Last month I bought a 5 GB UK eSIM through Prestmit and the whole checkout settled in satoshis: the QR code landed in my inbox before my coffee cooled. It felt pretty slick, but here’s what I’m still unsure about:

* Spread vs on-chain fee: The price was roughly spot +1.8 %, which beats some card FX rates, yet the miner fee that day nudged the total higher than a debit card would have.
* Liquidity risk: They auto-convert to local currency on their end, so I didn’t chase a buyer, but I wonder how sustainable that is if BTC drops 10 % mid-flight.
* Refunds/chargebacks: If the eSIM fails to activate, there’s no card dispute, just support tickets and hoping for a manual BTC return.

Purchase the esim, and right after purchase the same amount of BTC you spent with your exchange account. This drives adoption and usage of crypto.

The problem with BTC is that if everyone starts actually using BTC the way it was meant - as a peer-to-peer cash, rather than buying and holding and waiting for number to go up and sell back to government fiat - tx fees will go through the roof making it not plausible to use as P2P cash. So everyone then uses lightning network which is the great savior, but then it becomes peer-to-third party financial institution-to-peer electronic cash and at that point just use paypal or zelle.

BCH fixes this problem, tx fees always stay low, and remains peer-to-peer electronic cash without the need to trust third parties who charge fees and will censor you if you don't think the right thoughts.",True,2,🛠️ Services
