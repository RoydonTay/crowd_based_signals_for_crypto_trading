Decentralize or Die: A Manifesto Against Government Interference in Crypto,"The problem of people not seeing a problem when governments want to be part of the crypto world worries me. These guys are crooks and destroy everything good that is for the people, all in the name of pursuing their taxes and making people work for them like slaves just to survive.

Governments don't produce anything ‚Äî they use people to bag more money for their roles.

When they show interest in crypto, trust me, something is wrong. They can‚Äôt destroy it, so what they do is worse. They associate with corporations to buy it up, or use organizations to seize it ‚Äî all in the name of ‚Äúacceptance,‚Äù while in truth, what they want is more control. They want to monitor how and when it's used so they can charge what they claim belongs to them.

We aren't safe anymore, and the ones who are happy about the U.S. entering the crypto scenario are so blind ‚Äî believing in politicians is like taking a rope and putting it around your own neck.

It's time to use Bitcoin Cash, a truly decentralized coin and the real Bitcoin, to protect ourselves from these government people. Use CashFusion to stay free and use your BCH privately.

The Math of Cracking Missing Seed Words,"I recently released a new free and Creative Commons licensed [tutorial](https://youtu.be/R9IP5dLghzA) on the math of cracking missing seed words. I created a tool for calculating the number of missing bits, possible combinations, and estimated cracking times for pros and consumers.

One of the interesting things that I found is that the last word being included in the missing words makes a decent difference in the overall combinations and crack times for up to around 3 missing words, since the 4 to 8 checksum bits aren't included in the cracking operations.

TL;DR for about 1-3 missing words, cracking/recovering is possible and fairly likely. Once you get to 4-5 words, it becomes impractical or impossible. Anything above 6 and definitely a full seed is impossible.

These are [tables](https://imgur.com/a/3LF7fC3) I generated using my [code](https://github.com/chaintuts/seedwordsmith) to show the viability of cracking a certain amount of words, with and without the last word included.",False,2,üéì Education
indonesia might add bitcoin to reserves and it‚Äôs hitting my mindset,"i‚Äôve been following the crypto space for years and even i‚Äôm a bit stunned that indonesia‚Äôs vice president office is exploring bitcoin as a national reserve asset. they met with Bitcoin Indonesia, pitched mining using their hydro and geothermal power, and even mentioned allocating around $18 billion to btc holdings

they also talked about education initiatives and long term value...citing forecasts like $13 million per bitcoin by 2045

i‚Äôm honestly conflicted. part of me feels proud, this could legitimize bitcoin at a national level like no other. but another part of me is cautious, they still ban crypto payments, enforcement is inconsistent, and taxes on trading and mining have doubled recently

here‚Äôs what i keep thinking:

a government seriously considering btc for reserves isn‚Äôt hype. it's strategic.

indonesia has massive renewable energy...mining makes sense on paper.

but the math still scares me...$18b equals roughly 200‚ÄØ000 btc. that‚Äôs serious exposure.

i can‚Äôt afford to get too excited because there's still risk. policy can flip. enforcement might tighten. or the public education push could fall flat.

yet if it happens..if indonesia pushes forward, it might shift the sentiment globally. could trigger other nations to rethink reserve strategy. could boost btc just by signaling long term institutional trust.

from where i sit i‚Äôm holding. i might average in more if this escalates into actual policy. worst case it fizzles, btc stays sideways, taxes stay high, and regulations stay tight. best case indonesia opens the floodgates.",False,1,‚å® Discussion

> [early 2025 just proved why bitcoin's security model is superior](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1mir0lz/bros_keep_telling_me_to_switch_from_btc_but_early/)

My ask:

__Can you explain the ""security model"" you are talking about?__

So that we the arguments people make in favor of it can be properly evaluated. Fiat is not going to be replaced by something which can't at least properly argue for its future security and ability to replace whatever part of the existing financial system it is intended to replace.",False,3,‚å® Discussion
"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.","Fun Facts:

BTC, BSV or BCH security models are largely equivalent.   
  
By design, Bitcoins security model scales to:

1. The number of network participants using the network (aka Metcalfe's law) is instrumental in security.
2. Bitcoin's security subsidy shrinks over time to marginal cost to secure the network from point 1. above.
3. While the security subsidy depletes over time, security is transitioned to secure the average value transacted on the network.  **IE.** as the miners are paid to secure the network without subsidized security, they are dependent on transaction fees. Because transacting is optional and not guaranteed, miners in a free market are expected to encourage and optimize for high-volume and maximum revenue, aka economies of scale that are dependent on the network and network effect from point 1.
4. A tangent security benefit is safety in large numbers or the Oddity Effect, obfuscation the networks transactions leaving governments with the only option to follow the money when a crime is committed as opposed to blanket KYC legislation that moots privacy linking identity to transactions, in an age where AI can track everything. again point 1 the larger the number of transactions the greater the network effect the more secure the network is.

Both BCH and BTC for the most part retain these design features and are 100% equivalent.  
**The bottom line**, security of most forks of the Bitcoin ledger is equivalent and proportional to the perceived value of the token.

While BTC has a greater network effect, it is limited in transaction capacity, allowing KYC touchpoints with trusted third parties to link the majority of transactions with participants identity. Ultimately leaving BTC with an inferior security model to BCH.

TL;DR: token price relative to network effect = security.",True,6,‚å® Discussion
"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.",">**Can you explain the ""security model"" you are talking about?**

Security is a complex issue. It is foolish to restrict it to just a subset of the important properties. Some of the known and discussed BTC security issues:

* Security in the sense of certainty that transactions will be registered in the blockchain.
   * This has already become an issue, since there are more transactions coming than the network can store in the blockchain. BTC's ""security solution"" is to ignore the transactions that exceed the network limit. This is not really secure and it will exacerbate other issues.
* Security in the sense of certainty that an attacker will be unable to find the signature for some UTXO's he does not own.
   * It is well known (an algorithm has already been written) how to brute-force a signature for some coins provided one owns a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. The only obstacle is, that the existing quantum computers are not powerful enough.
   * When sufficiently powerful quantum computers will be developed, the only secure solution will be to switch to quantum-resistant signatures. This will have several security implications
      * It is known that a quantum-resistant signature will require a multiple of data sufficient for its quantum-unsecure counterpart. This will negatively affect the transaction throughput, lowering the likelihood that a transaction will be registered in the blockchain.
      * All UTXO's will have to be transformed from the existing quantum-unsecure form to a form using a quantum-resistant signature. This transformation will be a very demanding operation requiring billions of quantum-secure transactions to be registered in short time, which, as we know, the BTC network is not secure to do.",True,2,‚å® Discussion

"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.","Part of it is sunk cost. Miners spend billions of dollars on their mining infrastructure which cannot be used for anything else other than mining. 

Also the mining difficulty is adjusted so if it becomes too unprofitable for many miners, the mining difficulty is lessened to the point where it will maintain an order.

In essence, it will never get too easy where there will be way too many miners and never too hard where only a few thousand could profit. 

The main argument though for hackers or state organizations trying to take over miners is essentially multiple governments all over the world would have to have a coordinated take over the majority of miners which if ever successful would make the value of bitcoin zero.

bros keep telling me to switch from btc but early 2025 just proved why bitcoin's security model is superior,"been seeing a lot of posts lately about moving from bitcoin to eth for ""higher returns"" but honestly the recent events have me more convinced than ever that bitcoin's approach is the right one

yeah ethereum might pump harder sometimes but look what happened in early 2025 - billions got drained in that massive hack. meanwhile bitcoin's network just keeps chugging along like it has for 15+ years without a single successful direct attack on the protocol itself

the complexity argument is real. ethereum's got all these smart contracts and defi protocols creating endless attack vectors. every new feature is another potential way for someone to find an exploit and drain funds. bitcoin keeps it simple - peer to peer electronic cash, nothing fancy, nothing that can blow up in your face

and don't get me started on the regulatory stuff. sure ethereum got some wins with things like the genius act, but all that defi integration means way more regulatory surface area. one bad policy decision and the whole ecosystem could get hammered. bitcoin's just digital money - harder for governments to mess with without looking completely authoritarian

look i get it, ethereum has its place and the tech is impressive. but when people say ""move from bitcoin to eth for gains"" they're basically saying ""give up the most secure, battle-tested network for something flashier""

not saying ethereum is going to zero or anything, but calling bitcoin ""outdated"" while ethereum is getting billions stolen feels pretty backwards to me

"why bitcoin is the first choice for institutional treasuries, according to the numbers that actually matter","been thinking about what makes bitcoin the obvious pick for serious institutional money after seeing all these corporate treasury adoptions accelerate. the data tells a pretty clear story about why companies choose btc over everything else when they want to store real value.

the track record speaks for itself: bitcoin has been running for 16+ years without a single day of downtime. no rollbacks, no emergency shutdowns, no ""we need to pause the network"" moments. when microstrategy puts $42 billion into btc, they're betting on that reliability continuing forever.

the security model is unmatched: over $2 trillion in market cap secured by the most robust proof of work network ever built. hundreds of thousands of miners across every continent making it literally impossible to attack or control. institutions understand that this isn't just marketing, it's mathematical certainty.

no counterparty risk: when tesla buys bitcoin, they're not trusting any company, foundation, or development team to keep their money safe. they're trusting pure mathematics and thermodynamics. no single point of failure, no ceo that can change the rules, no governance token that can vote to confiscate funds.

the adoption metrics are wild:

$150+ billion in corporate treasuries (microstrategy, tesla, mara, etc)

spot etfs holding over $100 billion in just the first year

entire countries using it as legal tender

pension funds and insurance companies allocating billions

what institutions actually care about: forget smart contracts and defi yields. corporations want digital gold that can't be debased, confiscated, or controlled by any government or entity. bitcoin delivers exactly that and nothing else comes close to the same level of certainty.

the network effects are accelerating: every major bank now offers bitcoin services. payment processors integrate btc by default. accounting firms understand how to handle it. the infrastructure exists for institutions to buy, hold, and use bitcoin without technical complexity.

monetary policy you can audit: 21 million bitcoin, period. no inflation beyond the predetermined schedule that ends in 2140. institutions can literally verify the entire monetary policy by running the code. try doing that with any fiat currency or alternative crypto.

why this matters going forward: we're watching the transition from ""bitcoin is risky speculation"" to ""bitcoin is essential treasury infrastructure."" once institutions realize they can store value in something that can't be printed, debased, or controlled, the adoption becomes inevitable.

the numbers don't lie. corporate treasuries are voting with billions of dollars and they're choosing bitcoin over everything else for long term value storage. that tells you everything about where this is heading.

(Just a bit lower than now.)
What if coin price continues to rise ??

Or would you prefer to base an estimate on percentage of Market Cap ?  
I‚Äôve asked many Bitcoiners. Several hardcore ones have suggested between 1 to 2%  of Market Cap annually.

david bailey wants to raise $200m pac to push bitcoin to $10 million and abolish capital gains tax on btc sales,"david bailey just announced plans to raise a $100m to $200m political action committee focused entirely on advancing bitcoin interests in the us. this is the same guy who advised trump on bitcoin policy and basically orchestrated the entire political pivot that got us a pro crypto administration.

the scope of this pac is massive: bailey wants to anchor it through nakamoto holdings, his $300 million bitcoin treasury company. but the goals he outlined are way more ambitious than typical crypto lobbying. we're talking about fundamentally changing how america treats bitcoin.

primary objectives include:

pushing bitcoin price to $10 million (yes, he actually said this)

positioning bitcoin for long term dominance

abolishing capital gains tax on bitcoin sales

protecting self custody rights

legal protections for open source bitcoin developers

community suggestions are getting wild: stephan livera wants complete elimination of capital gains on btc. alex gladstein from human rights foundation is pushing for bitcoin debt payments from foreign countries, high school bitcoin education funding, and developer protection laws.

tuur demeester went even further, calling for full reserve banking requirements where banks must hold 100% of customer deposits in reserve. that would basically end fractional reserve banking as we know it.

this is different from previous crypto lobbying: fairshake pac spent $130 million in 2024 elections but focused on general crypto friendly candidates. bailey's pac would be bitcoin specific and aims to reshape fundamental economic policy around btc.

the fact that someone with direct trump administration connections is talking about $10 million bitcoin targets through political action tells you how seriously they're taking bitcoin's role in future policy.

potential concerns: charles allen from btcs warned bailey about fiduciary duty issues since he's using public company resources for political efforts. there's a real legal risk if shareholders think corporate funds are being misused for political activism.

bailey's response was that coinbase backed fairshake without issues, but allen pointed out that might not make sense in a pro crypto environment where corporate political spending isn't necessary.

the bigger picture: crypto companies spent $134 million on 2024 elections and won big. now we have elected officials who are actually pro bitcoin instead of just tolerating crypto. bailey sees this as the moment to push for structural changes while we have political momentum.

fairshake still has $141 million ready for future elections, but bailey's pac would be laser focused on bitcoin specific policy changes rather than general crypto acceptance.

what this could mean: if bailey successfully raises $200m and focuses it entirely on bitcoin policy priorities, we could see actual legislation around capital gains elimination, self custody protection, and bitcoin reserve banking requirements.

the $10 million price target isn't just speculation anymore when someone with this level of political access is building a war chest specifically to make it happen through policy changes.

anyone else thinking this might be the moment when bitcoin transitions from alternative asset to actual monetary policy tool?",False,3,üì∞ News

this fibonacci model has called every bitcoin move since $15k and says $166k is next...the math is actually scary accurate,"been diving into this fibonacci analysis from cryptocon and honestly, the pattern recognition is wild. this guy has been tracking btc since the ftx bottom at $15.5k and every major move has hit fibonacci extensions almost perfectly.

here's how it's played out since 2022:

$15,500 (cycle bottom after ftx collapse)

$30,362 (1.618 fib extension) - hit in april 2023, consolidation

$46,831 (2.618 extension) - hit january 2024, became support

$71,591 (3.618 extension) - touched march/june 2024, rejected twice

$109,236 (4.618 extension) - broken january 2025

next target: $166,754 (5.618 extension)

the spacing between these levels has been incredibly consistent. each leg up was around 52-54% gains before consolidation. we're currently sitting around $114k, which puts us in the transition zone between 4.618 and 5.618.

this isn't just technical hopium either:
every previous bitcoin cycle topped near specific fibonacci levels. 2013 peaked at the 5.618 extension around $1,150. 2017 hit just past 4.618 near $20k. even 2021's ""irregular"" cycle topped at $69k, which was almost exactly the 3.618 extension from 2018 lows.

the fundamental backdrop supports it:

post-halving dynamics still playing out (we're 16 months in)

etfs now hold $150b in assets (6.5% of total btc market cap)

regulatory clarity improving with genius act passing

strategic bitcoin reserve pilot program approved

but there are warning signs:
benjamin cowen points out that every post-halving year sees july/august gains followed by september corrections. we just had a 7.22% july gain, so if the pattern holds, we might see a pullback next month.

another analyst noted that profit-taking metrics are forming lower highs, suggesting each rally faces stronger selling pressure. we might get two more legs up before the cycle peaks.

what's interesting is the institutional component:
previous cycles were retail-driven. this one has blackrock holding 740k btc and institutions controlling 1 in every 15 bitcoin in circulation. that's a completely different market structure that could support higher prices.

the $166k target isn't some random moonshot number - it's where the math says we should go if this pattern continues. whether we get there in one shot or with corrections along the way is the real question.

the $112k dip might have been the best thing that happened to bitcoin... cause this setup looks too good to ignore,"just saw some interesting analysis about this weekend's btc dump to $112k and honestly, it might have been exactly what we needed. instead of freaking out about the selloff, let me break down why this could actually be setting up for a serious recovery.

the ""power of 3"" pattern is playing out perfectly: we've seen the classic accumulation phase ($119k-$115k), then manipulation (the dump to $112k), and now we might be entering distribution toward $126k. this isn't random, it's how institutional money operates while retail panics.

$922 million liquidation event cleared the deck: this was the biggest liquidation since february with $240m in btc futures alone. open interest dropped from $88b to $79b. when this much leverage gets flushed out, it removes the overhang that was keeping price suppressed.

funding rates flipped negative across exchanges: binance, bitmex, deribit all showing negative funding. that means shorts are paying longs to keep positions open. when retail is this bearish after a correction, it's usually time to start thinking contrarian.

binance taker volume hit -$1.5b: this level of aggressive selling hasn't been seen since july 25th. it's classic retail behavior - buy the top, sell the bottom. the panic selling around $114k was probably the capitulation we needed.

technical levels are lining up: the $112k-$115k zone was a major fair value gap that got filled. we bounced off the previous ath from may which is now acting as support. if we can reclaim $115.3k and $116.8k, $120k becomes a magnet with all that liquidation cluster sitting there.

why this feels different: previous corrections this cycle were about uncertainty. this one feels like a reset. leverage got flushed, weak hands got shaken out, and funding rates reset. the market structure actually looks healthier now than before the dump.

we're sitting around $114k right now but the signs are pointing toward a bounce. when you combine technical rebound signals with sentiment washing out and leverage being cleared, you get the setup for sustained moves higher.

not saying we're immediately going to $126k, but this correction might have done exactly what was needed to continue the bull market instead of ending it.

From CFDs to real Bitcoin,"Not sure if it‚Äôs for this sub, but here we go.

A few years back, I got into BTC through eToro, but only with CFDs. At the time, it seemed the easiest way, and as a beginner, I didn‚Äôt know what spreads were, let alone that eToro‚Äôs spreads are much higher than most real crypto exchanges. I paid extra for that, but the returns have been great so I didn‚Äôt really care at the time.

Now I want to actually own my BTC. My plan is to sell the CFDs, withdraw to my bank, buy real BTC (only BTC) through an exchange, and then move it to my own wallet.

Timing is always a bit of a gamble, since I could end up selling during a local peak and buying back during a dip, or the other way around. I know there‚Äôs never a perfect moment, but I want to be in control and accept that risk.

A few things I‚Äôm still unsure about:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Hardware wallet, or would you trust a good software wallet for long-term holding and why?
‚Ä¢	‚Å†For a EU resident, which exchange would you recommend for buying real BTC?

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Is there any reason not to go full self-custody, or any alternatives worth considering?

Balancing maxi brain with degen curiosity: how do you keep your BTC conviction while still poking around new-launch land?,"The sub is having another round of soul-searching about ""Bitcoin‚Äôs lost its way,"" institutional custody, KYC creep, you name it. I‚Äôm firmly in the self-custody, long-term-savings camp, but I‚Äôll be honest: I still wander off-trail to scout fresh Sol/Base memes for fun money. The problem is information overload. If you scroll CT or DEX feeds for ten minutes, every new cartoon dog is ""the future of payments,"" and suddenly my hard-earned sats start to look‚Ä¶ slow.

So I split my headspace into two lanes:

* Core stack: hardware wallet, no rehypothecation, DCA, ignore the price until the next halving.
* Curiosity sandbox: tiny allocation I can literally afford to round down to zero. For that I run a saved filter in BananaGun Pro that surfaces sub-five-minute launches so I can scratch the degen itch quickly, then rotate any winnings back into BTC cold storage.

Keeping the buckets separate has two nice side effects:

1. It reminds me how calm Bitcoin actually is, ten minutes in launch-chart hell makes one-block confirmations feel like a spa day.
2. When a meme goes 5x and I swap it into sats, it reinforces the ""BTC as base unit"" mindset instead of letting me spiral into unit bias.

Questions for the hive mind:

* Do you maintain a similar sandbox, or is it 100 % orange-pilled monk mode?
* How do you avoid the cynicism that creeps in when you watch altcoins pump 30 % in an hour while Bitcoin grinds in a $500 range?",False,3,

‚Å†> Do you maintain a similar sandbox, or is it 100 % orange-pilled monk mode?

No, I‚Äôm interested in using Bitcoin as permission-less P2P cash, that‚Äôs what grabbed my attention.
I used to own BTC back when fees were always super low and it actually looked like it could be the future of payments.
As time went on Steam, Microsoft and a bunch of other high profile companies start experimenting with it but high fees and full blocks made 0-conf unreliable and transactions too expensive.

BTC has a stupid CAGR, which by low estimates is 30%‚Ä¶ that means, if you put 25k into BTC on a 30 % CAGR, it‚Äôll be worth over a million in 10 years, and closer to 2 million in like 12 years‚Ä¶ if the CAGR cuts in half immediately even, it‚Äôd still be more than 30.

"btc hodlers are panic selling into binance at 7k btc per day while whales dump everything, this selloff is different","been watching the onchain data and this selloff is way nastier than the price action suggests. short-term holders just dumped 40k btc at a loss in 24 hours - that's the most panic selling since july 15th. meanwhile binance is seeing 7k btc inflows daily, up from 5.3k just a month ago.

here's what's actually happening:

the exchange whale ratio spiked above 0.70, meaning most of these deposits are coming from whales, not retail. when big money starts dumping this hard, especially on weekends when liquidity is thin, you know something's wrong.

august 1st alone saw 16,417 btc in net inflows to exchanges. that's not normal weekend flow - that's institutional money bailing out before monday.

the timing tells the whole story:

this started when btc first broke $110k in early july. since then, we've seen a steady increase in selling pressure that everyone ignored because price kept going up. but now the dam is breaking.

what's scary is this isn't just retail getting shaken out. the us bitcoin etfs had $812 million in outflows on august 1st - the second largest daily drawdown ever. institutional money is running for the exits alongside the whales.

analyst skew pointed out something interesting:

the weekend order book activity was ""not your average weekend price action."" large players were quoting massive size just to facilitate their exits without completely crashing the market. that takes serious money.

we're sitting at $114k right now but the flow data suggests this bounce is temporary. when you have 7k btc hitting binance daily and whales dominating the deposits, the path of least resistance is down.

the market structure has completely flipped since july. before that, inflows were declining for months - classic accumulation phase. now we're seeing the reverse as smart money distributed into retail fomo.

what's different this time:

institutional money is selling alongside whales

short-term holders are capitulating at losses

exchange flows show sustained selling pressure, not just volatility

weekend dumping suggests urgency, not planned profit-taking

this feels like the start of a deeper correction, not just a dip. when whales and institutions both head for the exits at the same time, retail usually gets left holding the bag.

anyone else seeing this pattern in the data? or am i reading too much into what could just be normal profit-taking after the recent run? either way, probably smart to have awaken.tax ready for all the tax-loss harvesting opportunities this correction might create.",False,0,‚å® Discussion

Some advice. When you start keep your BTC on the exchange. The exchange account is safe enough for these amounts, and going full in with your own wallet has many risks in its own and any mistake with your own wallet risks you permanently losing your coins.

The exchange account is like a bank account. Quite well protected but in the hands of the exchange and not really your coins.

Having the coins in your own wallet is like withdrawing cash. You are fully responsible for managing the coins and no one will guard you from doing stupid things.

When you approach about 0.05 BTC then start looking into setting up your own wallet for long term use.

Until then take your time and learn more about what Bitcoin is. Set up a soft wallet on your mobile and one on your computer to play around with and learn the basics, but transfer only a very small amount there and let the rest stay on the exchange until you are ready to set up your real wallet.",True,1,

"Arthur Hayes just dumped $13M in crypto and thinks BTC is heading back to $100k, here's why he might be right","Arthur Hayes dropped some serious FUD yesterday and honestly, his track record makes it worth paying attention to. The BitMEX founder just offloaded over $13 million worth of ETH, ENA, and PEPE, then warned that Bitcoin could retrace all the way back to $100k.

His reasoning? The macro picture is getting ugly fast.

July jobs report was absolute trash, only 73k new jobs when we needed way more

Credit growth is basically dead across major economies

GDP growth is stalling out everywhere you look

Tariff fears are ramping up again

Hayes isn't some random Twitter analyst either. When this guy moves $13M out of crypto positions and goes 81% cash (mostly USDC), you pay attention. His wallet now sits at $28.3M with $22.95M parked in stablecoins.

What a $100k Bitcoin would mean: That's an 18.7% correction from the $123k high we hit in July. Not exactly moon mission territory, but also not the end of the world. BTC has already dropped 7.7% from that peak, so we're partway there.

The interesting part is how divided people are on this. You've got Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas pointing out that Bitcoin volatility has been way more tame since the ETF approvals. Mitchell Askew from Blockware is saying the days of brutal bear markets are over.

But Hayes is looking at the bigger picture - when credit tightens and jobs disappear, risk assets get hammered. Doesn't matter if institutions are buying if the macro environment goes to shit.

My take: Hayes has been through multiple cycles and made bank timing these moves. If he's this bearish while sitting on a massive cash position, maybe it's time to at least consider that this bull run might need to take a breather.

The question isn't whether Bitcoin survives (it will), but whether we're about to see that classic macro-driven correction that reminds everyone crypto still moves with risk-on sentiment.

So everyone then uses lightning network which is the great savior, but then it becomes peer-to-third party financial institution-to-peer electronic cash and at that point just use paypal or zelle.

FED interest rates are actually set by the President of the NY Fed branch‚Äïunilaterally.

It's for this reason that the largest banks (Chase & Citi, etc) are ALWAYS the largest shareholders of the NY FED. They essentially, secretly, own a controlling interest on monetary policy in the US.

Bitcoin Has Lost Its Way...,"A lot of people think my interview with Roger Ver was a turning point when I left the church of Bitcoin maximalism 

In fact, I started questioning it when the culture became obviously non-libertarian during the pandemic

Asking Gary Gensler‚Äôs SEC to label everything other than BTC as an unregistered security

Defending KYC & weird surveillance practices, by saying that at least the service is ‚ÄúBitcoin only and doesn‚Äôt support any shitcoin‚Äù

Slaying guys like Andreas Antonopoulos who honestly is the reason many of us stuck around

Pushing idiots with nothing interesting to say to speak on conference stages just because they are ‚Äúbullish‚Äù

Shitting on projects that have been nothing but nice and supportive to Bitcoin (Litecoin, Zcash) and others that do what Bitcoin cannot (Ethereum, Monero)

Replacing reason with dogma and enforcing everything with a weird sense of self-confidence that stalls progress

Acting like any network upgrade is an attack, despite intensive testing on other compatible networks 

Vilifying developers to the point that they ragequit to build something else, while those who stay are incentivized to play along with the meme culture just to earn a paycheck 

Worshipping Saylor, who is against the values of Bitcoin‚Äôs early days

Sucking up to politicians and selling out to government agencies because ‚Äúeverything is good for Bitcoin‚Äù and ‚ÄúHoneybadger don‚Äôt care‚Äù

Pretending that a federation like Liquid is decentralized and the L-BTC token is actually bitcoin (the market chose Ethereum for this use case, lol)

Repeating lies about Lightning Network‚Äôs success, when the project has been stagnating in terms of liquidity for years

Acting like bitcoin adoption in El Salvador (mostly custodial, surveilled by the state) is going the way it‚Äôs supposed to and other countries should copy the same example 

Looking the other way while bitcoin payments get replaced by stablecoins and BTC adoption was in fact higher a decade ago

Changing history and erasing the contributions of OGs only to appeal to institutional investors that may make the number go up (who still remembers Gavin Andresen or Mike Hearn?)

Making up narratives on the go, manufacturing fake news in order to manipulate the market sentiment and get another pump

Suppressing conversations about serious improvement proposals, which would help Bitcoin scale to 8 billion people and offer monetary fungibility 

Keeping builders away from Bitcoin with a hostile and cocky attitude which assumes victory before any significant battle has been won

Not giving a fuck about the disappearance of privacy products & research (Ethereum raised millions of dollars to defend the Tornado Cash devs, while bitcoiners simply shrugged when Samourai devs got arrested)

Normalizing a culture of complacency where you‚Äôre afraid of saying something wrong (or even remotely different from the social consensus) because you might just be excommunicated 

Promoting sheepish mediocrity while pushing away radical reformists (Paul Sztorc, Jeremy Rubin)

Forgetting history (today was UASF day, does anyone still remember?)

Never giving the benefit of the doubt to other networks that build cool shit, only because they have tokens which compete with bitcoin.

"metaplanet just announced $3.7 billion bitcoin treasury raise, asia's corporate btc accumulation getting serious","so japan's metaplanet (known as ""asia's microstrategy"") just dropped news that they're raising 555 billion yen ($3.7 billion) through preferred shares to buy more bitcoin. their target? 210,000 btc by end of 2027.

this is actually huge for several reasons:

the scale is insane we're talking about a japanese company planning to acquire 1% of bitcoin's entire supply over the next 3 years. at current prices that's around $25 billion worth of btc they want to accumulate. for context, microstrategy has 607,000 btc after years of buying.

**the funding structure is smart** they're issuing perpetual preferred shares with up to 6% annual dividend. basically letting investors get exposure to their bitcoin strategy while collecting yield. this is the same playbook saylor pioneered but adapted for japanese capital markets.

corporate treasury trend accelerating this announcement came right after crypto treasury firms hit $100 billion collectively, with $93 billion of that in bitcoin. we're watching the institutionalization of btc happen in real time across different continents.

timing with macro conditions matrixport's research suggests bitcoin's next major catalyst could hit in september when congress reconvenes and fiscal uncertainty returns. historically that's been massive for hard assets, and now we have corporate treasuries positioned to absorb any supply.

the supply math is brutal between microstrategy continuing to buy, metaplanet targeting 210k btc, and dozens of other corporate treasuries accumulating, the available supply for retail is shrinking fast. when you factor in etf inflows and mining rewards getting absorbed, we're looking at a legitimate supply crunch.

validation of the treasury model seeing a major japanese firm copy microstrategy's playbook validates that this isn't just one crazy ceo's strategy. it's becoming a legitimate corporate finance approach across different regulatory environments and cultures.

the fact that metaplanet is calling themselves ""asia's microstrategy"" shows how normalized this bitcoin treasury strategy has become. what started as saylor's unconventional experiment is now being replicated by institutions worldwide.

if metaplanet successfully raises this $3.7 billion and executes their plan, we could see other asian companies follow suit. south korea, singapore, taiwan - imagine if corporate bitcoin adoption spreads across the entire region.

the september fiscal uncertainty catalyst matrixport mentioned could be perfect timing for these treasury companies to deploy fresh capital. congress returning to debates about debt ceiling and spending could drive institutional money into bitcoin just as these companies have maximum firepower.

anyone else seeing how this corporate accumulation trend changes the entire bitcoin landscape? feels like we're past the point of no return on institutional adoption.",False,4,

Buying with CC in New York?,"Coinbase removed the Credit Card option entirely due to some unsavory people using cards of people they do not know, so that's for all U.S. states.

However, I heard that other brokerages refuse CC usage if you're in NY/NYC even if it's advertised you can use it. Can someone point me to the right place where I can use a CC to purchase any crypto? I can also use cash and money order but realistically the only thing an exchange would take is a CC. 

It also has to be on an exchange that gives me a seed phrase so I can ""recover"" it on a safer wallet and send it to a second wallet on the safer wallet system. I'm open to suggestions for a good safe wallet for Windows, though I think I know one already.

I can go to NJ just to log in, but if I'm making the account, it will be while I'm in NYC and also all my IDs say ""NY"" on them. :/

Buying with CC in New York?,"NY has their own rules, but they shouldn't preclude you from using a CC.


Have you tried linking a bank account to use ACH transfer?


Honestly, no legit seller should accept CC for crypto without a pre-existing business relationship with the customer or long time delays. CC tx can be reversed. Cryptocurrency ones cannot. So they'd be taking on a lot of unnecessary risk.

The only safe wallet is Bitcoin Core. But bear in mind that is going to require a long sycnig process and lots of hard drive space (about a half a terabyte last I checked).


I don't know of any exchange that is going to give you a Bitcoin seed phrase. There would never be any legitimate reason for you and your exchange to share private keys, which this would imply. Instead, to save long term, you should generate your own seed wallet then send the Bitcoin from the exchange to your wallet.

I think nowadays all American exchanges have to report to the IRS, but not necessarily to you. Keep track. I don't recommend making a ton of trades until you figure out if they're going to send you a form.

The Court Finally Approved the Settlement Between Singularity and its Investors After Crypto Pivot Scandal,"Hey guys, if you missed it, Singularity Future Technology ($SGLY), formerly Sino-Global, has agreed to settle $3M with investors over hiding key info during its 2021 pivot from shipping to cryptocurrency hardware. And the court finally approved the agreement. So, here‚Äôs a quick recap.



In early 2021, the company rebranded itself as a blockchain and crypto hardware player, claiming proprietary mining rigs and large-scale partnerships. $SGLY jumped after announcements of server purchases and joint ventures like Thor Miner and a $200M deal with SOS. Later, it claimed a $250M partnership with Golden Mainland.



But by mid-2022, Hindenburg and Peabody exposed major red flags showing that Thor Miner had no proprietary products, Golden Mainland had a fake address, and the entire crypto strategy appeared fabricated.¬†



Additionally, the CEO, Yang Jie, was also revealed to have ties to a Ponzi scheme in China. So, basically, Singularity had sold more than $21M in unregistered securities while promoting deals that didn‚Äôt exist.



As the truth surfaced, the stock collapsed more than 90%, and investors filed a lawsuit.  
  
  
Now, Singularity has agreed to a $3M settlement, and investors can already [file claims](https://11th.com/cases/singularity-investor-suit) to get payment from this agreement. 



Anyways, did anyone here hold $SGLY during its so-called ‚Äúcrypto transformation‚Äù?
