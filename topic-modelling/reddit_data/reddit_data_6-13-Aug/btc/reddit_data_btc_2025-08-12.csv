63% BTC and climbing… everything else feels like dead weight,"Just checked my portfolio and the trend is crystal clear:
	•	BTC: 0.105583 ($12,607.80) 63.41%

Value of money as a function of fees needed to use it,"Think about it.

Ideal money that you don't need to pay fees to use, transfers the full value on every transaction.

Physically, the closest we have come to that is __cash__, although that also suffers from some costs imposed by the issuers (incl. inflation, ""the hidden tax"") and wear & tear on the physical media (coins or paper).

Electronically, since Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of blockchains, we have more options, ranging from chains where you pay zero/almost zero fees to chains which may have high fees per transaction.

The value you get out of your coins is related to the amount of fees you need to pay to spend them.

If you end up needing to spend all your money on fees, the value of those coins to you is:

0.

Does BTC need future proofing?,"I don't think all that many holders worry about security and decentralization. They see an asset going up faster than anything else they've seen before and they want some of that growth.

Edit: Since 'altruistic' appears to inspire debate, I'll provide a definition for my usage. In this context altruistic means being motivated not by the benefit one might receive themselves but by the benefit others might receive. It's intimately tied to intent.

It's defined in the OED dictionary as ""the belief in or practice of disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others.""

To clarify, wanting security and decentralization because you think it's going to make the world better for everyone around you is altruistic. Wanting security and decentralization because someone told you btc provides it and that's the way you can get rich, or save your purchasing power, that's not altruistic.

Does BTC need future proofing?,"Arguing about 'store of value' versus 'payment system' doesn't matter, when Bitcoin with Lightning solves both. Here's a nice video about the topic, especially with the longer term view: https://youtu.be/aWtzOQTv8Dc?si=Nfq4rJZuv9gSR1Xh

Lightning in the solution to scaling the payments. (Later in this comment, I mention other systems; Bitcoin is not relying exclusively on Lightning)

It's ""trustless"" in the sense that your Lightning payments are as safe as the on-chain payments. I.e. there is zero risk to you, if you follow the process correctly, _even if everyone else on Lightning tries to steal your money_

There is no limit on the number of transactions that Lightning can handle. One on-chain transaction is needed to onboard a new user (i.e. Lightning wallet), but typically a user can then proceed with thousands of Lightning transactions without requiring any new more on-chain transactions.

Imagine 100,000 users joining each day for a year. After a year, assuming each just makes 10 transactions per day, we will have 365,000,000 transactions per day. Lightning handles this easily, with instant trustless transactions.

No other Bitcoin-related system can do this. For example, Bitcoin Cash has not presented any plan for handling hundreds of millions of transactions per day, despite having had eight years to plan for this.

You might be wondering why Lightning isn't so visible yet in the ""real world"". As bitcoin is still vastly underpriced, many people who understand Bitcoin are hoarding it instead of spending it. But that will change gradually as the economic incentives change.

So basically, Lightning is ready and is already in heavy use behind the scenes, and there are plenty of smart people working on similar systems (the Ark Protocol is another Layer 2 for Bitcoin, which can work separately from - or can interact with - Lightning) to fill all the various tradeoffs (speed, trust, fee minimisation, ..).

A friend suggested I look into GoMining — instead of running your own rig, you basically “rent” hashing power from their data centers. I was skeptical at first, but the idea of mining without the heat, noise, and electric bill was appealing.

What I liked so far:
• No hardware to buy or maintain (I’ve blown up enough PC fans in my life)
• You can start with a small amount — I began with just enough to see if it actually works
• Daily payouts straight to your wallet

What I’m watching closely:
• Long-term ROI — with BTC prices swinging, I want to see how it does over a few months
• Fees and payout schedules — it’s not “free money,” but neither is running a rig at home

btc hits $122k and analysts are looking at $125k...where's the next resistance?,"bitcoin just touched $122,230 today after being stuck around $112k last week. that's a 65% gain from the april lows if anyone's keeping track. now citi analysts are talking $125k targets, but the real question is what happens after we break current resistance levels.

right now btc is testing the $123,200 all-time high as immediate resistance. this level held back previous attempts and there's likely selling pressure from people who bought the previous peak.

if we clear $123,200 convincingly, the next psychological resistance hits at $125,000. round numbers always create resistance as traders take profits and institutions rebalance portfolios.

but here's where it gets interesting, after $125k, the next major resistance zone doesn't appear until around $135k-$140k. that's roughly where fibonacci extensions and previous cycle patterns suggest institutional selling might emerge.

$135k-$140k range: this aligns with fibonacci extension levels from previous cycles. also where some models predict institutional profit-taking could emerge as bitcoin reaches roughly 15% of gold's market cap.

$150k psychological barrier: another round number that creates natural resistance. at this level, bitcoin's market cap would approach $3 trillion, putting it closer to microsoft or apple territory.

$160k-$175k zone: based on logarithmic trend channels, this range represents where previous bull market extensions have typically peaked before major corrections. For traders navigating these levels, especially those with significant gains to track, services like awaken.tax can help manage the complexity of crypto tax reporting as positions move through these resistance zones.

"They don't need a CBDC if they can get a network of centralized ""stablecoins""","Centralized stablecoins offer the main features of CBDCs:

- Can be printed (inflated) as necessary (ask Tether)
- Can be mass surveilled (most are transparent blockchains lacking any privacy features and require users to perform KYC/AML i.e. to definitively identify themselves to the operators)
- Can be controlled (funds frozen, transactions blocked, conditions on spending enforced by the operators of centralized & permissioned stablecoins)

As such, they may _look_ like cryptocurrency to the lay public, but they are closer to a distributed form of CBDC.

In the case of centralized USD stablecoins, one could say they together form a ""synthetic CBDC"" even though the central banks (like the Fed in this case) have maintained separation distance for plausible deniability. Because the concept of CBDCs has deservedly gotten a bad reputation already, esp. after a few central bankers and elites essentially dropped hints of why they favored such systems over the legacy banking/money structures.

__Does this mean stablecoins are generally bad?__

In my opinion, no.

There can be __decentralized stablecoins__ that do not require particular trusted intermediaries and do not need to suffer from the type of surveillance and control problems associated with centralized ones.

Such decentralized stablecoins are closer to the idea of p2p cash than to fiat money, and can bring Bitcoin's default level of pseudonymity plus, if suitable mixed (perhaps with something similar to CashFusion), they could enhance privacy beyond what Bitcoin can offer.

Eth vs Btc: What is the reality?,"So eth just hit its highest weekly close since 2021 at 4,300. The ETH/BTC ratio doubled from its April low, and suddenly everyone's asking if Bitcoin is losing market share. but whats the reality?

i caught two takes today that got me thinking:

first, Samson Mow argues the recent eth rally is fueled by bitcoin holders rotating capital into eth for short-term gain...only to dump it once prices get high enough and shift profits back into btc. he calls this the “bagholder’s dilemma.” current eth/btc ratio is around 0.036, double its april low, but he warns eth faces a sell-off once it hits key psychological levels

Secomd, Willy Woo called Bitcoin the ""perfect asset for the next 1000 years"" - and looking at longer timeframes, the fundamentals remain unchanged. Bitcoin's market cap is still only 11% of gold's $23 trillion, meaning we're far from complete adoption.

The real question isn't whether ETH can pump another 12% to hit its ATH. It's whether Bitcoin continues building toward becoming a world reserve asset. And for that to happen, we need way more capital flowing in.

in short term flows, eth sees spikes from traders chasing yield, but profits often rotate back to btc

in long tem confidrence, btc remains the default store of value

in short, btc isn’t losing its dominance, capital flow dynamics shift over cycles, but fundamentals still favor bitcoin for many institutions. eth can rally within those windows, but its staying power depends on sustained narratives, not just hype.

either way, if you're actively trading between eth and btc or taking profits on these moves, platforms like awaken.tax become pretty essential for tracking cost basis across all the swaps and rotations.",FALSE,1,🤔 Opinion

The Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG) is a ""clean"" investment vehicle that acquires BCH without using debt, representing a passive exposure trust for buyers.



In stark contrast, MicroStrategy, a company with limited software business growth, uses a leveraged strategy to acquire Bitcoin. It funds its purchases with debt and new share issuances. This approach amplifies returns but also introduces risk; a significant market crash could force the company to liquidate its Bitcoin holdings to cover debts or drastically dilute its shares, making them nearly worthless for existing investors.



While MicroStrategy's large-scale purchases are often cited for creating Bitcoin's supply scarcity, BCHG's accumulation of hundreds of thousands of BCH suggests a similar dynamic is at play with Bitcoin Cash. Both assets share a hard cap of 21 million units, and some argue that as BCH is continually absorbed by buyers like BCHG, the market may eventually realize this scarcity, potentially leading to sharp price increases as available supply on exchanges dwindles.

It was all stolen last summer and we just figured it out a few weeks ago.   It was most likely the Electrum vulnerability that got him, but he swears he was never given an update prompt.   The way the vulnerability works is it prompts the user with a fake malicious update and when the user gives their password it installs malware allowing them to steal the BTC.   I think it was long enough ago that he just forgot about it, and probably gave his password for the update.   It wasn't because he was sloppy with his seed words because when we went to import the wallet on another computer we discovered he had one of the seed words spelled wrong and we had to go back into the windows 7 laptop to get the correct words from Electrum.",TRUE,2,

💡 Professional Tip:

Avoid entering in the middle between 118,384 and 119,541 — that’s a “noise zone” with no clear edge.

Use 1-2% max of your capital per trade to manage risk.

If BTC shows strong momentum, you can trail your stop loss behind each previous swing low/high to lock profits.",FALSE,0,

BTC,"I would cost average in, instead of taking out a loan. Safer that way if crypto takes a loss. But if you really want to take on the risk, only take the loan if you can comfortably pay it back on time and be okay if crypto crashes - nothing wrong with that. It's just all the people I know who got wealthy post 2017 were cost averaging in and not taking loans, which means you take the amount that you would pay on the loan and just buy crypto instead ever month. There are people who took loans at crypto highs in 2020-21 and then took losses to cover the loan and then missed out on the recent gains - rekt.

And it's much wiser to diversify your crypto holdings. Not just BTC. Don't go into shit coins and meme coins, stick to blue chip cryptos. BTC, ETH, BCH, SOL, etc.

And if you're really serious about investing in crypto/bitcoin, do some research and study what the hell it is about. Don't listen to the hordes of idiots who think this is a casino, put their money on red/black/btc, wait for number to go up and cash out. Do some actual research and figure out why Bitcoin was created, what are it's use-values, and look into what gives something value, maybe some Austrian economics which uses logic and not wishful thinking. Maybe actually *use* crypto instead of sticking it in a wallet and letting it sit there. There are safe ways to earn interest on your crypto that don't rely on centralized trust - smart contracts to lend your crypto in return for fee rewards. Be an investor not a gambler. I think you're leaning towards gambling, good luck.",TRUE,3,

how close are we to bitcoin hitting new ath this week? $142k possible?,"saw merlijn's bitcoin bull run cheat sheet and some analysis suggesting btc might actually break to new highs within days. wanted to break down what i'm seeing here.

current situation: btc sitting around $118,500 after bouncing from $112k support. the chart shows we're potentially in the final accumulation phase before the next major move up.

technical setup looks interesting:

formed a bullish flag pattern since june 22nd when we bottomed at $98k and peaked at the $123k ath

flag has a height of about $25k, which typically projects to around $142k if we break above $117k resistance

already showing signs of breaking above the upper flag boundary

holding above 100-day ema and completed a break-and-retest at the $112k level

what's driving this potential move:

etf inflows jumped $246m last week after bleeding $643m the week before

exchange supply at multi-year lows while demand keeps increasing

fed rate cut probability rising after weak jobs data

cpi data coming tuesday could be the catalyst if it comes in weak

the cycle timing also matches historical patterns. looking at merlijn's chart, we've had bear phases lasting 1300-1500 days followed by accumulation periods of around 1400 days. if the pattern holds, we should be transitioning into the actual bull run phase right about now.

if we do hit those targets, gonna be interesting to see how the tax implications play out. platforms like awaken.tax are probably gonna see a surge in activity as people try to figure out their gains on what could be some pretty wild moves.

rsi crossed above 50, macd turning bullish, momentum building. feels like we're setting up for either a major breakout or a significant rejection at these levels.

what's your take? are we actually ready for $142k or is this just another false breakout before more consolidation? the technical setup seems solid but crypto has a way of doing the opposite of what everyone expects.",FALSE,0,⌨ Discussion

Decentralize or Die: A Manifesto Against Government Interference in Crypto,"The BCH community have refused to try to scale Bitcoin.

Imagine 100,000 users each day start using some form of Bitcoin, and each of those makes ten transactions every day from the day they are onboarded.

After one year, that means 365,000,000 million transactions per day. Bitcoin Cash obviously can't support that, especially as they refuse to put Lightning on top of their Bitcoin Cash chain. **Bitcoin Cash would crash and burn within days of trying to onboard these users**.

Bitcoin _with Lightning_ solves this. It takes only one on-chain transaction, typically costing about $1, to onboard the user. After they are onboarded, they can make essentially unlimited transactions

Lightning transactions are instant. And they are instantly confirmed; i.e. they are fully ""trustless"". Lightning balances are _not_ IOUs. You can always move your Lightning balance onto the chain _even if nobody else cooperates and if they try to steal your funds_

By contrast, it takes roughly ten minutes (at the least) to have any confidence that a Bitcoin Cash transaction has completed

In short, the BCH has had 8 years to deploy Lightning, or some suitable alternative if they think they can do better, to deliver huge numbers of instant, trustless, transactions. But they haven't even tried

Nobody, not even the most hardcore big-blocker BCH fanboy, really thinks that making that blocks 32 times bigger - or even a thousand times bigger - would deliver the super-high rate of instant trustless transactions that we get with Lightning",TRUE,-2,

🧵 Bitcoin Chain Selection: Who Wins in a Fork?,"Ever wonder how Bitcoin picks the “real” chain when there’s a split?
It doesn’t count blocks. It picks the chain with the most proof of work.

Let’s say there’s a fork:
Chain A adds 1 block at the old, tougher difficulty.
Chain B adds 2 blocks, but after a difficulty drop.
Which one wins?

Not the longer one. The heavier one.

Bitcoin adjusts mining difficulty every ~2 weeks to keep block times around 10 minutes.
If blocks are coming in too slow, the difficulty drops. That makes mining easier.

Say the difficulty falls by a third.
Now 1 old-difficulty block = 3 units of work.
Each new-difficulty block = 1 unit of work.

So:
Chain A = 1 × 3 = 3 units
Chain B = 2 × 1 = 2 units

Even though it’s shorter, Chain A wins. More work = more weight.

Bitcoin doesn’t care about who got there first or who added more blocks.
It cares who did more work. That’s the chain the network follows.

You can’t bluff your way to consensus.
You’ve gotta put in the hash 💪

🧵 Bitcoin Chain Selection: Who Wins in a Fork?,"> Ever wonder how Bitcoin picks the “real” chain when there’s a split?
> It doesn’t count blocks. It picks the chain with the most proof of work.

That's only partly correct and highly depends on what you mean by fork.


For example if there are two blocks mined at the same time they compete for the being the actual chain and chain header. Some other miner will find a block on top of one of them and all miners will realign themselves onto the new ""most work"" blockchain header. In this case you are correct. This works because all the miners follow the same ruleset. 


In the other case where there is a chain split, two rulesets exists for the creation of the next block and nakamoto consensus cannot tell you which ruleset is the ""right"" one. Miners have to choose which ruleset they follow and support with their hash and people have to decide which ruleset is ""their"" chain. 

In case of the BCH/BTC split, people were let to believe that hashrate is all that matters and that let to false believes like yours. But there are a multitude of things that one needs to consider. Imagine BTC split into BTC and NEWBTC and the old BTC implemented tail emission. Since it pays miners more its hashrate would be greater but would you consider it Bitcoin? 

In the end most people picked the most easy way out and choose by branding, which was unfortunately also assigned by the capturers before the split and not after.",TRUE,5,🎓 Education

this btc chart pattern looks exactly like before the 70k to 108k moonshot,"been staring at the charts all morning and stumbled across some analysis that's got me pretty bullish. trader galaxy just dropped some comparison charts showing btc is literally copying the same pattern that led to those massive gains in late 2024.

remember that run from 70k to 108k? apparently we're sitting in almost the exact same spot right now. btc is doing this support retest thing where it broke through a trendline and now it's coming back to test that line as support. last time this happened, price discovery mode kicked in and we rocketed straight up.

galaxy posted on twitter saying ""last time it looked like this it was before the run from 70k to 100k."" the setup is almost identical - btc breaks resistance, pulls back to retest it as support, then if it holds we get liftoff.

now obviously it's not a perfect copy. this time the trendline is ascending instead of descending, and we've got all this macro stuff with trade tariffs messing with risk assets. but the structure is remarkably similar.

what's really interesting is the swing low pattern galaxy spotted. we hit swing lows in april and june, and both times those levels held as the bottom - never got revisited. friday we briefly dipped below 112k for another swing low. if history repeats, that might be our floor.

another thing - analysts are saying btc probably won't repeat that nasty 30% dump we saw after hitting aths earlier this year. instead they're looking at that 109.3k january peak as ultimate support. so even if we do go lower, we're not talking about a major crash.

honestly this whole sideways action we've been in feels like accumulation before the next leg up. reduced volatility, consolidation around these levels, institutions still buying the dip. classic btc behavior before it decides to move violently in one direction.

if we do get another major run like the 70k to 108k move, anyone actively trading these swings should probably start thinking about tax implications early. tracking cost basis and timing becomes way more important when you're looking at potential 50%+ gains, especially with all the talk about possible capital gains changes. tools like awaken.tax can help keep everything organized before things get crazy again.

the consensus seems to be that btc is going to pick a direction soon after weeks of this boring price action. if this pattern comparison holds up, that direction might be straight up.

what do you guys think? are you seeing the same similarities in the charts? or is this just hopium disguised as technical analysis?

personally i'm keeping my dca going and watching that support level closely. if it holds and we start pushing higher, this could be the setup for another 50% run.",FALSE,0,

Guide to receive-only app on my phone?,"Neither of my phones are safe. I have had so many phishing and malware attacks but either all my data was immune to them or there was just nothing to make actual use of without impersonating me.

And what app can easily be used to check the status of transactions I make from a secure device when sending it away?  I'm on Android.

I also wanted to ask if anyone has a problem in forcing Sparrow to show them their seed phrase and what type of wallet I should even create (segwit, nested segwit...something else?) and why I shouldn't use 12 words when I'm starting small. 12 words seems to be on the smaller end of what ppl use these days.",FALSE,5,❓ Question 
Guide to receive-only app on my phone?,"Mobile Electrum watch-only by importing singular public keys or a master public key. You can copy an address from it and paste it anywhere to receive, check balance

It's especially good in combination with a cold device - meaning no Internet connection ever on the device - with Electrum on it to create and manage private keys. For good operational security also choose a secure physical form to store seed, and also remember it

Same for BCH with Electron Cash, if fees are a consideration and if BCH fits the use case

> why I shouldn't use 12 words when I'm starting small. 12 words seems to be on the smaller end of what ppl use these days

If 12-word seed method of private key management would ever be in danger from quantum computing, and if protocol won't be upgraded in time, having 24-word seed would do nothing - you would have, marginally more secured coins, let's say for a time, but with destroyed purchasing power from the realized risk

The Math of Cracking Missing Seed Words,"I recently released a new free and Creative Commons licensed [tutorial](https://youtu.be/R9IP5dLghzA) on the math of cracking missing seed words. I created a tool for calculating the number of missing bits, possible combinations, and estimated cracking times for pros and consumers.

One of the interesting things that I found is that the last word being included in the missing words makes a decent difference in the overall combinations and crack times for up to around 3 missing words, since the 4 to 8 checksum bits aren't included in the cracking operations.

TL;DR for about 1-3 missing words, cracking/recovering is possible and fairly likely. Once you get to 4-5 words, it becomes impractical or impossible. Anything above 6 and definitely a full seed is impossible.

indonesia might add bitcoin to reserves and it’s hitting my mindset,"i’ve been following the crypto space for years and even i’m a bit stunned that indonesia’s vice president office is exploring bitcoin as a national reserve asset. they met with Bitcoin Indonesia, pitched mining using their hydro and geothermal power, and even mentioned allocating around $18 billion to btc holdings

they also talked about education initiatives and long term value...citing forecasts like $13 million per bitcoin by 2045

i’m honestly conflicted. part of me feels proud, this could legitimize bitcoin at a national level like no other. but another part of me is cautious, they still ban crypto payments, enforcement is inconsistent, and taxes on trading and mining have doubled recently

here’s what i keep thinking:

a government seriously considering btc for reserves isn’t hype. it's strategic.

indonesia has massive renewable energy...mining makes sense on paper.

but the math still scares me...$18b equals roughly 200 000 btc. that’s serious exposure.

i can’t afford to get too excited because there's still risk. policy can flip. enforcement might tighten. or the public education push could fall flat.

yet if it happens..if indonesia pushes forward, it might shift the sentiment globally. could trigger other nations to rethink reserve strategy. could boost btc just by signaling long term institutional trust.

from where i sit i’m holding. i might average in more if this escalates into actual policy. worst case it fizzles, btc stays sideways, taxes stay high, and regulations stay tight. best case indonesia opens the floodgates. btw make sure you're tracking everything properly for taxes been using awaken.tax to keep all my staking rewards and trades organized",FALSE,2,⌨ Discussion

"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.","Claim:

> [early 2025 just proved why bitcoin's security model is superior](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1mir0lz/bros_keep_telling_me_to_switch_from_btc_but_early/)

My ask:

__Can you explain the ""security model"" you are talking about?__

So that we the arguments people make in favor of it can be properly evaluated. Fiat is not going to be replaced by something which can't at least properly argue for its future security and ability to replace whatever part of the existing financial system it is intended to replace.",FALSE,6,⌨ Discussion
"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.","Fun Facts:

BTC, BSV or BCH security models are largely equivalent.   
  
By design, Bitcoins security model scales to:

1. The number of network participants using the network (aka Metcalfe's law) is instrumental in security.
2. Bitcoin's security subsidy shrinks over time to marginal cost to secure the network from point 1. above.
3. While the security subsidy depletes over time, security is transitioned to secure the average value transacted on the network.  **IE.** as the miners are paid to secure the network without subsidized security, they are dependent on transaction fees. Because transacting is optional and not guaranteed, miners in a free market are expected to encourage and optimize for high-volume and maximum revenue, aka economies of scale that are dependent on the network and network effect from point 1.
4. A tangent security benefit is safety in large numbers or the Oddity Effect, obfuscation the networks transactions leaving governments with the only option to follow the money when a crime is committed as opposed to blanket KYC legislation that moots privacy linking identity to transactions, in an age where AI can track everything. again point 1 the larger the number of transactions the greater the network effect the more secure the network is.

Both BCH and BTC for the most part retain these design features and are 100% equivalent.  
**The bottom line**, security of most forks of the Bitcoin ledger is equivalent and proportional to the perceived value of the token.

While BTC has a greater network effect, it is limited in transaction capacity, allowing KYC touchpoints with trusted third parties to link the majority of transactions with participants identity. Ultimately leaving BTC with an inferior security model to BCH.

TL;DR: token price relative to network effect = security.",TRUE,7,⌨ Discussion
"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.",">**Can you explain the ""security model"" you are talking about?**

Security is a complex issue. It is foolish to restrict it to just a subset of the important properties. Some of the known and discussed BTC security issues:

* Security in the sense of certainty that transactions will be registered in the blockchain.
   * This has already become an issue, since there are more transactions coming than the network can store in the blockchain. BTC's ""security solution"" is to ignore the transactions that exceed the network limit. This is not really secure and it will exacerbate other issues.
* Security in the sense of certainty that an attacker will be unable to find the signature for some UTXO's he does not own.
   * It is well known (an algorithm has already been written) how to brute-force a signature for some coins provided one owns a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. The only obstacle is, that the existing quantum computers are not powerful enough.
   * When sufficiently powerful quantum computers will be developed, the only secure solution will be to switch to quantum-resistant signatures. This will have several security implications
      * It is known that a quantum-resistant signature will require a multiple of data sufficient for its quantum-unsecure counterpart. This will negatively affect the transaction throughput, lowering the likelihood that a transaction will be registered in the blockchain.
      * All UTXO's will have to be transformed from the existing quantum-unsecure form to a form using a quantum-resistant signature. This transformation will be a very demanding operation requiring billions of quantum-secure transactions to be registered in short time, which, as we know, the BTC network is not secure to do.",TRUE,2,⌨ Discussion

Also the mining difficulty is adjusted so if it becomes too unprofitable for many miners, the mining difficulty is lessened to the point where it will maintain an order.

In essence, it will never get too easy where there will be way too many miners and never too hard where only a few thousand could profit. 

The main argument though for hackers or state organizations trying to take over miners is essentially multiple governments all over the world would have to have a coordinated take over the majority of miners which if ever successful would make the value of bitcoin zero.

2. Post some price charts, make bold predictions about flipping gold by next year. 

3. Troll the skeptics to death, even if they’re right. Don’t admit any flaw – when in doubt, refer to commandment one. 

4. Slay your idols. Well, except for the high priests who get a free pass for shitcoining. They are cool, at least until Mr. Hodl or Giacomo tells you that they’re not. 

5. Anyone who uses the Bitcoin codebase to build anything without the blessing of Blockstream is a shitcoiner who deserves to get slain. 

6. Liquid is a sidechain and Lightning is the one true way to scale Bitcoin. Anyone claiming otherwise is a shitcoiner who deserves to get slain. 

7. Ethereum is a bigger enemy than bankers, politicians & spooks infiltrated within the community. Make fun of Ethereum at least 3 times a week, then praise JP Morgan, the Trump family and BlackRock for being such bitcoin bulls. If you discover that they buy ethereum too, refer to commandment no. 4!

8. The community is decentralized and diverse, so nobody speaks for Bitcoin except for Greg Maxwell and 3 other guys who can effectively shut down initiatives to improve the project. You think Bitcoin needs improvements? Refer to commandment no. 1!

9. If you came to Bitcoin in 2017 or later, you’re a pleb and you will always be a pleb. Be happy about it pleb, embrace the name and never question your OG overlords. 

10. It is always better to be a pleb who posts memes and “mines fiat”. What do you mean you want Bitcoin to scale to 8 billion people? Don’t you like custodial lightning? Refer to commandment no. 1 and repent, or else you’re a shitcoiner.

bros keep telling me to switch from btc but early 2025 just proved why bitcoin's security model is superior,"been seeing a lot of posts lately about moving from bitcoin to eth for ""higher returns"" but honestly the recent events have me more convinced than ever that bitcoin's approach is the right one

yeah ethereum might pump harder sometimes but look what happened in early 2025 - billions got drained in that massive hack. meanwhile bitcoin's network just keeps chugging along like it has for 15+ years without a single successful direct attack on the protocol itself

the complexity argument is real. ethereum's got all these smart contracts and defi protocols creating endless attack vectors. every new feature is another potential way for someone to find an exploit and drain funds. bitcoin keeps it simple - peer to peer electronic cash, nothing fancy, nothing that can blow up in your face

and don't get me started on the regulatory stuff. sure ethereum got some wins with things like the genius act, but all that defi integration means way more regulatory surface area. one bad policy decision and the whole ecosystem could get hammered. bitcoin's just digital money - harder for governments to mess with without looking completely authoritarian

look i get it, ethereum has its place and the tech is impressive. but when people say ""move from bitcoin to eth for gains"" they're basically saying ""give up the most secure, battle-tested network for something flashier""

the tax implications alone make this tricky - switching between assets creates taxable events that tools like awaken.tax help track, but you're still dealing with complexity that hodling bitcoin avoids entirely

not saying ethereum is going to zero or anything, but calling bitcoin ""outdated"" while ethereum is getting billions stolen feels pretty backwards to me

am i missing something here or does the security track record speak for itself?",FALSE,2,

Honestly, that is the worst argument I have ever heard, and that isn't even accounting for the $3.5 billion Bitcoin hack in 2020 that was revealed this week",TRUE,6,
bros keep telling me to switch from btc but early 2025 just proved why bitcoin's security model is superior,"Should ETH contentiously fork, there is no energy signature, one who would want to follow ""true chain"" - would have to judge social media dynamics, read posts, choose which accounts to trust. Sustaining attack on ETH would require just media noise

Should Bitcoin contentiously fork, one can throw hands up and just silently watch number of zeroes in blocks flying towards him. Sustaining attack on Bitcoin would require BOTH media noise and burning energy

PoS is fundamentally flawed, think carefully about what actually did Satoshi invent",TRUE,3,
bros keep telling me to switch from btc but early 2025 just proved why bitcoin's security model is superior,"The ByBit hack could just as well had been BTC. It was a leaked waller, not a protocol weakness.

But you are entirely correct in the assessment that BTC is superior to ETH for long term.store of value.

The two have fundamentally different goals. And both have their place.

The primary goal for ETH is to act as gas and security for the ecosystem around it. And as a byproduct it gains some value.

The primary goal for BTC is to be a form of money/value.",TRUE,4,

Bitcoin’s been bulletproof for 15+ years, and that’s not something to brush off. ETH is cool for building, sure, but that flexibility comes with big risks, as we saw in 2025.

That said, I still like spreading exposure. I’ve been watching $WHITE closely it's built like Bitcoin when it comes to stability, but designed to support real-world asset tokenization and high-speed finality. Basically, it brings fresh use cases without opening a hundred new attack vectors.

So yeah, BTC for safety, but smart to have eyes on next-gen chains too.",TRUE,-4,
