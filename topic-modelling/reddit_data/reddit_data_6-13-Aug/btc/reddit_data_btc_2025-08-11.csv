Eth vs Btc: What is the reality?,"So eth just hit its highest weekly close since 2021 at 4,300. The ETH/BTC ratio doubled from its April low, and suddenly everyone's asking if Bitcoin is losing market share. but whats the reality?

i caught two takes today that got me thinking:

first, Samson Mow argues the recent eth rally is fueled by bitcoin holders rotating capital into eth for short-term gain...only to dump it once prices get high enough and shift profits back into btc. he calls this the “bagholder’s dilemma.” current eth/btc ratio is around 0.036, double its april low, but he warns eth faces a sell-off once it hits key psychological levels

Secomd, Willy Woo called Bitcoin the ""perfect asset for the next 1000 years"" - and looking at longer timeframes, the fundamentals remain unchanged. Bitcoin's market cap is still only 11% of gold's $23 trillion, meaning we're far from complete adoption.

The real question isn't whether ETH can pump another 12% to hit its ATH. It's whether Bitcoin continues building toward becoming a world reserve asset. And for that to happen, we need way more capital flowing in.

in short term flows, eth sees spikes from traders chasing yield, but profits often rotate back to btc

in long tem confidrence, btc remains the default store of value

in short, btc isn’t losing its dominance, capital flow dynamics shift over cycles, but fundamentals still favor bitcoin for many institutions. eth can rally within those windows, but its staying power depends on sustained narratives, not just hype.",False,2,🤔 Opinion
Eth vs Btc: What is the reality?,🚀🚀🛸🛸,True,1,🤔 Opinion
Eth vs Btc: What is the reality?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1mmfuqm/microstrategy_has_accumulated_600k_btc_by_taking/

MicroStrategy has accumulated 600k BTC by taking on **tens of billions of dollars in loans and debt**. BCHG fund has acquired **400k BCH through straightforward purchases, with no debt or leverage**. BCH shares the same supply scarcity as Bitcoin, investors are betting on its potential growth trajectory.

Grayscale's Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG) has acquired 391,239 BCH through outright purchases, calculated as 0.00830246 BCH per share multiplied by 47,123,300 shares: https://www.grayscale.com/funds/grayscale-bitcoin-cash-trust 

In contrast, MicroStrategy holds 628k BTC, but its average purchase price is continually increasing due to new leveraged purchases. This approach creates a risk of liquidation overhang, as the company will eventually need to repay its debts. Should BTC experience a significant crash, instead of facing insolvency, **the company might be forced to either use customer-held Bitcoin assets to settle debts or to drastically increase its share count. The latter action would dilute the value for current shareholders, effectively transferring majority ownership to its creditors**: https://saylortracker.com/",True,1,🤔 Opinion
"They don't need a CBDC if they can get a network of centralized ""stablecoins""","Centralized stablecoins offer the main features of CBDCs:

- Can be printed (inflated) as necessary (ask Tether)
- Can be mass surveilled (most are transparent blockchains lacking any privacy features and require users to perform KYC/AML i.e. to definitively identify themselves to the operators)
- Can be controlled (funds frozen, transactions blocked, conditions on spending enforced by the operators of centralized & permissioned stablecoins)

As such, they may _look_ like cryptocurrency to the lay public, but they are closer to a distributed form of CBDC.

In the case of centralized USD stablecoins, one could say they together form a ""synthetic CBDC"" even though the central banks (like the Fed in this case) have maintained separation distance for plausible deniability. Because the concept of CBDCs has deservedly gotten a bad reputation already, esp. after a few central bankers and elites essentially dropped hints of why they favored such systems over the legacy banking/money structures.

__Does this mean stablecoins are generally bad?__

In my opinion, no.

There can be __decentralized stablecoins__ that do not require particular trusted intermediaries and do not need to suffer from the type of surveillance and control problems associated with centralized ones.

Such decentralized stablecoins are closer to the idea of p2p cash than to fiat money, and can bring Bitcoin's default level of pseudonymity plus, if suitable mixed (perhaps with something similar to CashFusion), they could enhance privacy beyond what Bitcoin can offer.

USDC is liquid and it's fantastic for crossing borders. It would become a CBDC if ever USDC contract would get an update to include expiration date for tokens

I estimate such risk as low. And risk of freezes is low with correct OPSEC and self-custody. No points where stabelcoins may be connected to any bank account is part of OPSEC

Stablecoins are not for savings, but for some usecases they are much better than even cash

> decentralized stablecoins

Can't wait until any would match at least USDC in liquidity. Part of overall risk mitigation is hiding in numbers, liquidity is a must",True,1,⌨ Discussion

how close are we to bitcoin hitting new ath this week? $142k possible?,"saw merlijn's bitcoin bull run cheat sheet and some analysis suggesting btc might actually break to new highs within days. wanted to break down what i'm seeing here.

current situation: btc sitting around $118,500 after bouncing from $112k support. the chart shows we're potentially in the final accumulation phase before the next major move up.

technical setup looks interesting:

formed a bullish flag pattern since june 22nd when we bottomed at $98k and peaked at the $123k ath

flag has a height of about $25k, which typically projects to around $142k if we break above $117k resistance

already showing signs of breaking above the upper flag boundary

holding above 100-day ema and completed a break-and-retest at the $112k level

what's driving this potential move:

etf inflows jumped $246m last week after bleeding $643m the week before

exchange supply at multi-year lows while demand keeps increasing

fed rate cut probability rising after weak jobs data

cpi data coming tuesday could be the catalyst if it comes in weak

the cycle timing also matches historical patterns. looking at merlijn's chart, we've had bear phases lasting 1300-1500 days followed by accumulation periods of around 1400 days. if the pattern holds, we should be transitioning into the actual bull run phase right about now.

rsi crossed above 50, macd turning bullish, momentum building. feels like we're setting up for either a major breakout or a significant rejection at these levels.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG) is a ""clean"" investment vehicle that acquires BCH without using debt, representing a passive exposure trust for buyers.



In stark contrast, MicroStrategy, a company with limited software business growth, uses a leveraged strategy to acquire Bitcoin. It funds its purchases with debt and new share issuances. This approach amplifies returns but also introduces risk; a significant market crash could force the company to liquidate its Bitcoin holdings to cover debts or drastically dilute its shares, making them nearly worthless for existing investors.



While MicroStrategy's large-scale purchases are often cited for creating Bitcoin's supply scarcity, BCHG's accumulation of hundreds of thousands of BCH suggests a similar dynamic is at play with Bitcoin Cash. Both assets share a hard cap of 21 million units, and some argue that as BCH is continually absorbed by buyers like BCHG, the market may eventually realize this scarcity, potentially leading to sharp price increases as available supply on exchanges dwindles.

I recommend you be scientific about it, you need to have a set of seed words for every vulnerable attack vector. And you need to create a new set of seed words when you get a new phone and repeat the experiment. Otherwise, you won't be able to see where your security was weak or where it failed.

It was all stolen last summer and we just figured it out a few weeks ago.   It was most likely the Electrum vulnerability that got him, but he swears he was never given an update prompt.   The way the vulnerability works is it prompts the user with a fake malicious update and when the user gives their password it installs malware allowing them to steal the BTC.   I think it was long enough ago that he just forgot about it, and probably gave his password for the update.   It wasn't because he was sloppy with his seed words because when we went to import the wallet on another computer we discovered he had one of the seed words spelled wrong and we had to go back into the windows 7 laptop to get the correct words from Electrum.",True,2,

this btc chart pattern looks exactly like before the 70k to 108k moonshot,"been staring at the charts all morning and stumbled across some analysis that's got me pretty bullish. trader galaxy just dropped some comparison charts showing btc is literally copying the same pattern that led to those massive gains in late 2024.

remember that run from 70k to 108k? apparently we're sitting in almost the exact same spot right now. btc is doing this support retest thing where it broke through a trendline and now it's coming back to test that line as support. last time this happened, price discovery mode kicked in and we rocketed straight up.

galaxy posted on twitter saying ""last time it looked like this it was before the run from 70k to 100k."" the setup is almost identical - btc breaks resistance, pulls back to retest it as support, then if it holds we get liftoff.

now obviously it's not a perfect copy. this time the trendline is ascending instead of descending, and we've got all this macro stuff with trade tariffs messing with risk assets. but the structure is remarkably similar.

what's really interesting is the swing low pattern galaxy spotted. we hit swing lows in april and june, and both times those levels held as the bottom - never got revisited. friday we briefly dipped below 112k for another swing low. if history repeats, that might be our floor.

another thing - analysts are saying btc probably won't repeat that nasty 30% dump we saw after hitting aths earlier this year. instead they're looking at that 109.3k january peak as ultimate support. so even if we do go lower, we're not talking about a major crash.

honestly this whole sideways action we've been in feels like accumulation before the next leg up. reduced volatility, consolidation around these levels, institutions still buying the dip. classic btc behavior before it decides to move violently in one direction.

if we do get another major run like the 70k to 108k move, anyone actively trading these swings should probably start thinking about tax implications early. tracking cost basis and timing becomes way more important when you're looking at potential 50%+ gains, especially with all the talk about possible capital gains changes. tools like awaken.tax can help keep everything organized before things get crazy again.

the consensus seems to be that btc is going to pick a direction soon after weeks of this boring price action. if this pattern comparison holds up, that direction might be straight up.

what do you guys think? are you seeing the same similarities in the charts? or is this just hopium disguised as technical analysis?

personally i'm keeping my dca going and watching that support level closely. if it holds and we start pushing higher, this could be the setup for another 50% run.",False,0,

🧵 Bitcoin Chain Selection: Who Wins in a Fork?,"Ever wonder how Bitcoin picks the “real” chain when there’s a split?
It doesn’t count blocks. It picks the chain with the most proof of work.

Let’s say there’s a fork:
Chain A adds 1 block at the old, tougher difficulty.
Chain B adds 2 blocks, but after a difficulty drop.
Which one wins?

Not the longer one. The heavier one.

Bitcoin adjusts mining difficulty every ~2 weeks to keep block times around 10 minutes.
If blocks are coming in too slow, the difficulty drops. That makes mining easier.

Say the difficulty falls by a third.
Now 1 old-difficulty block = 3 units of work.
Each new-difficulty block = 1 unit of work.

So:
Chain A = 1 × 3 = 3 units
Chain B = 2 × 1 = 2 units

Even though it’s shorter, Chain A wins. More work = more weight.

Bitcoin doesn’t care about who got there first or who added more blocks.
It cares who did more work. That’s the chain the network follows.

You’ve gotta put in the hash 💪

🧵 Bitcoin Chain Selection: Who Wins in a Fork?,"> Ever wonder how Bitcoin picks the “real” chain when there’s a split?

That's only partly correct and highly depends on what you mean by fork.


For example if there are two blocks mined at the same time they compete for the being the actual chain and chain header. Some other miner will find a block on top of one of them and all miners will realign themselves onto the new ""most work"" blockchain header. In this case you are correct. This works because all the miners follow the same ruleset. 


In the other case where there is a chain split, two rulesets exists for the creation of the next block and nakamoto consensus cannot tell you which ruleset is the ""right"" one. Miners have to choose which ruleset they follow and support with their hash and people have to decide which ruleset is ""their"" chain. 

In case of the BCH/BTC split, people were let to believe that hashrate is all that matters and that let to false believes like yours. But there are a multitude of things that one needs to consider. Imagine BTC split into BTC and NEWBTC and the old BTC implemented tail emission. Since it pays miners more its hashrate would be greater but would you consider it Bitcoin?

Decentralize or Die: A Manifesto Against Government Interference in Crypto,"The problem of people not seeing a problem when governments want to be part of the crypto world worries me. These guys are crooks and destroy everything good that is for the people, all in the name of pursuing their taxes and making people work for them like slaves just to survive.

Governments don't produce anything — they use people to bag more money for their roles.

When they show interest in crypto, trust me, something is wrong. They can’t destroy it, so what they do is worse. They associate with corporations to buy it up, or use organizations to seize it — all in the name of “acceptance,” while in truth, what they want is more control. They want to monitor how and when it's used so they can charge what they claim belongs to them.

We aren't safe anymore, and the ones who are happy about the U.S. entering the crypto scenario are so blind — believing in politicians is like taking a rope and putting it around your own neck.

Decentralize or Die: A Manifesto Against Government Interference in Crypto,"The BCH community have refused to try to scale Bitcoin.

Imagine 100,000 users each day start using some form of Bitcoin, and each of those makes ten transactions every day from the day they are onboarded.

After one year, that means 365,000,000 million transactions per day. Bitcoin Cash obviously can't support that, especially as they refuse to put Lightning on top of their Bitcoin Cash chain. **Bitcoin Cash would crash and burn within days of trying to onboard these users**.

Bitcoin _with Lightning_ solves this. It takes only one on-chain transaction, typically costing about $1, to onboard the user. After they are onboarded, they can make essentially unlimited transactions

Lightning transactions are instant. And they are instantly confirmed; i.e. they are fully ""trustless"". Lightning balances are _not_ IOUs. You can always move your Lightning balance onto the chain _even if nobody else cooperates and if they try to steal your funds_

By contrast, it takes roughly ten minutes (at the least) to have any confidence that a Bitcoin Cash transaction has completed

In short, the BCH has had 8 years to deploy Lightning, or some suitable alternative if they think they can do better, to deliver huge numbers of instant, trustless, transactions. But they haven't even tried

Nobody, not even the most hardcore big-blocker BCH fanboy, really thinks that making that blocks 32 times bigger - or even a thousand times bigger - would deliver the super-high rate of instant trustless transactions that we get with Lightning",True,-2,

The Math of Cracking Missing Seed Words,"I recently released a new free and Creative Commons licensed [tutorial](https://youtu.be/R9IP5dLghzA) on the math of cracking missing seed words. I created a tool for calculating the number of missing bits, possible combinations, and estimated cracking times for pros and consumers.

One of the interesting things that I found is that the last word being included in the missing words makes a decent difference in the overall combinations and crack times for up to around 3 missing words, since the 4 to 8 checksum bits aren't included in the cracking operations.

TL;DR for about 1-3 missing words, cracking/recovering is possible and fairly likely. Once you get to 4-5 words, it becomes impractical or impossible. Anything above 6 and definitely a full seed is impossible.

indonesia might add bitcoin to reserves and it’s hitting my mindset,"i’ve been following the crypto space for years and even i’m a bit stunned that indonesia’s vice president office is exploring bitcoin as a national reserve asset. they met with Bitcoin Indonesia, pitched mining using their hydro and geothermal power, and even mentioned allocating around $18 billion to btc holdings

they also talked about education initiatives and long term value...citing forecasts like $13 million per bitcoin by 2045

i’m honestly conflicted. part of me feels proud, this could legitimize bitcoin at a national level like no other. but another part of me is cautious, they still ban crypto payments, enforcement is inconsistent, and taxes on trading and mining have doubled recently

here’s what i keep thinking:

a government seriously considering btc for reserves isn’t hype. it's strategic.

indonesia has massive renewable energy...mining makes sense on paper.

but the math still scares me...$18b equals roughly 200 000 btc. that’s serious exposure.

i can’t afford to get too excited because there's still risk. policy can flip. enforcement might tighten. or the public education push could fall flat.

yet if it happens..if indonesia pushes forward, it might shift the sentiment globally. could trigger other nations to rethink reserve strategy. could boost btc just by signaling long term institutional trust.

from where i sit i’m holding. i might average in more if this escalates into actual policy. worst case it fizzles, btc stays sideways, taxes stay high, and regulations stay tight. best case indonesia opens the floodgates. btw make sure you're tracking everything properly for taxes been using awaken.tax to keep all my staking rewards and trades organized",False,2,⌨ Discussion

While the security subsidy depletes over time, security is transitioned to secure the average value transacted on the network.  **IE.** as the miners are paid to secure the network without subsidized security, they are dependent on transaction fees. Because transacting is optional and not guaranteed, miners in a free market are expected to encourage and optimize for high-volume and maximum revenue, aka economies of scale that are dependent on the network and network effect from point 1.
4. A tangent security benefit is safety in large numbers or the Oddity Effect, obfuscation the networks transactions leaving governments with the only option to follow the money when a crime is committed as opposed to blanket KYC legislation that moots privacy linking identity to transactions, in an age where AI can track everything. again point 1 the larger the number of transactions the greater the network effect the more secure the network is.

Both BCH and BTC for the most part retain these design features and are 100% equivalent.  
**The bottom line**, security of most forks of the Bitcoin ledger is equivalent and proportional to the perceived value of the token.

While BTC has a greater network effect, it is limited in transaction capacity, allowing KYC touchpoints with trusted third parties to link the majority of transactions with participants identity. Ultimately leaving BTC with an inferior security model to BCH.

TL;DR: token price relative to network effect = security.",True,7,⌨ Discussion
"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.",">**Can you explain the ""security model"" you are talking about?**

Security is a complex issue. It is foolish to restrict it to just a subset of the important properties. Some of the known and discussed BTC security issues:

* Security in the sense of certainty that transactions will be registered in the blockchain.
   * This has already become an issue, since there are more transactions coming than the network can store in the blockchain. BTC's ""security solution"" is to ignore the transactions that exceed the network limit. This is not really secure and it will exacerbate other issues.
* Security in the sense of certainty that an attacker will be unable to find the signature for some UTXO's he does not own.
   * It is well known (an algorithm has already been written) how to brute-force a signature for some coins provided one owns a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. The only obstacle is, that the existing quantum computers are not powerful enough.
   * When sufficiently powerful quantum computers will be developed, the only secure solution will be to switch to quantum-resistant signatures. This will have several security implications
      * It is known that a quantum-resistant signature will require a multiple of data sufficient for its quantum-unsecure counterpart. This will negatively affect the transaction throughput, lowering the likelihood that a transaction will be registered in the blockchain.
      * All UTXO's will have to be transformed from the existing quantum-unsecure form to a form using a quantum-resistant signature. This transformation will be a very demanding operation requiring billions of quantum-secure transactions to be registered in short time, which, as we know, the BTC network is not secure to do.",True,2,⌨ Discussion
"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.","Ummm there are just as many wallets as there are atoms in the observable universe. Good luck finding one with something in it.

Bitcoins hashrate is 1 zeta hash. Impossible to 51% attack without going bankrupt. 

Bitcoins programming is changed by a supermajority of nodes (20,000+ around the world and growing) reaching consensus. So it’s incredibly difficult to alter. 

Your value is secure because it cannot be diluted. Never has there been such an asset.

"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.","Miners will keep mining. Nobody doubts any more that Bitcoin mining will continue, verifying transactions and avoiding double-spending and all that good stuff

There has never been any downtime in mining. You would need to basically switch the internet off globally to cause a serious problem; and even then the problem would only be temporary and the network would reorg automatically",True,1,⌨ Discussion
"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.","Part of it is sunk cost. Miners spend billions of dollars on their mining infrastructure which cannot be used for anything else other than mining. 

Also the mining difficulty is adjusted so if it becomes too unprofitable for many miners, the mining difficulty is lessened to the point where it will maintain an order.

In essence, it will never get too easy where there will be way too many miners and never too hard where only a few thousand could profit. 

The main argument though for hackers or state organizations trying to take over miners is essentially multiple governments all over the world would have to have a coordinated take over the majority of miners which if ever successful would make the value of bitcoin zero. Same for hackers trying to do a 51 percent attack. If a hack that large was ever successful bitcoin value would evaporate so there is no incentive for them to do that.",True,1,⌨ Discussion

bros keep telling me to switch from btc but early 2025 just proved why bitcoin's security model is superior,"been seeing a lot of posts lately about moving from bitcoin to eth for ""higher returns"" but honestly the recent events have me more convinced than ever that bitcoin's approach is the right one

yeah ethereum might pump harder sometimes but look what happened in early 2025 - billions got drained in that massive hack. meanwhile bitcoin's network just keeps chugging along like it has for 15+ years without a single successful direct attack on the protocol itself

the complexity argument is real. ethereum's got all these smart contracts and defi protocols creating endless attack vectors. every new feature is another potential way for someone to find an exploit and drain funds. bitcoin keeps it simple - peer to peer electronic cash, nothing fancy, nothing that can blow up in your face

and don't get me started on the regulatory stuff. sure ethereum got some wins with things like the genius act, but all that defi integration means way more regulatory surface area. one bad policy decision and the whole ecosystem could get hammered. bitcoin's just digital money - harder for governments to mess with without looking completely authoritarian

look i get it, ethereum has its place and the tech is impressive. but when people say ""move from bitcoin to eth for gains"" they're basically saying ""give up the most secure, battle-tested network for something flashier""

the tax implications alone make this tricky - switching between assets creates taxable events that tools like awaken.tax help track, but you're still dealing with complexity that hodling bitcoin avoids entirely

"why bitcoin is the first choice for institutional treasuries, according to the numbers that actually matter","been thinking about what makes bitcoin the obvious pick for serious institutional money after seeing all these corporate treasury adoptions accelerate. the data tells a pretty clear story about why companies choose btc over everything else when they want to store real value.

the track record speaks for itself: bitcoin has been running for 16+ years without a single day of downtime. no rollbacks, no emergency shutdowns, no ""we need to pause the network"" moments. when microstrategy puts $42 billion into btc, they're betting on that reliability continuing forever.

the security model is unmatched: over $2 trillion in market cap secured by the most robust proof of work network ever built. hundreds of thousands of miners across every continent making it literally impossible to attack or control. institutions understand that this isn't just marketing, it's mathematical certainty.

no counterparty risk: when tesla buys bitcoin, they're not trusting any company, foundation, or development team to keep their money safe. they're trusting pure mathematics and thermodynamics. no single point of failure, no ceo that can change the rules, no governance token that can vote to confiscate funds.

the adoption metrics are wild:

$150+ billion in corporate treasuries (microstrategy, tesla, mara, etc)

spot etfs holding over $100 billion in just the first year

entire countries using it as legal tender

pension funds and insurance companies allocating billions

what institutions actually care about: forget smart contracts and defi yields. corporations want digital gold that can't be debased, confiscated, or controlled by any government or entity. bitcoin delivers exactly that and nothing else comes close to the same level of certainty.

the network effects are accelerating: every major bank now offers bitcoin services. payment processors integrate btc by default. accounting firms understand how to handle it. the infrastructure exists for institutions to buy, hold, and use bitcoin without technical complexity. tools like awaken.tax are becoming standard for proper treasury management and compliance tracking.

monetary policy you can audit: 21 million bitcoin, period. no inflation beyond the predetermined schedule that ends in 2140. institutions can literally verify the entire monetary policy by running the code. try doing that with any fiat currency or alternative crypto.

why this matters going forward: we're watching the transition from ""bitcoin is risky speculation"" to ""bitcoin is essential treasury infrastructure."" once institutions realize they can store value in something that can't be printed, debased, or controlled, the adoption becomes inevitable.

the numbers don't lie. corporate treasuries are voting with billions of dollars and they're choosing bitcoin over everything else for long term value storage. that tells you everything about where this is heading.

anyone else seeing this institutional adoption accelerate faster than expected? or are we still early enough that most companies haven't figured out they need bitcoin exposure yet?",False,0,

What if coin price continues to rise ??

I’ve asked many Bitcoiners. Several hardcore ones have suggested between 1 to 2%  of Market Cap annually.

The 10 commandments of Bitcoin Maximalism. 

1. Do nothing, really. Bitcoin is already perfect, so why bother? Stack sats and wait for the day you’re a fiat billionaire. 

2. Post some price charts, make bold predictions about flipping gold by next year. 

3. Troll the skeptics to death, even if they’re right. Don’t admit any flaw – when in doubt, refer to commandment one. 

4. Slay your idols. Well, except for the high priests who get a free pass for shitcoining. They are cool, at least until Mr. Hodl or Giacomo tells you that they’re not. 

5. Anyone who uses the Bitcoin codebase to build anything without the blessing of Blockstream is a shitcoiner who deserves to get slain. 

6. Liquid is a sidechain and Lightning is the one true way to scale Bitcoin. Anyone claiming otherwise is a shitcoiner who deserves to get slain. 

7. Ethereum is a bigger enemy than bankers, politicians & spooks infiltrated within the community. Make fun of Ethereum at least 3 times a week, then praise JP Morgan, the Trump family and BlackRock for being such bitcoin bulls. If you discover that they buy ethereum too, refer to commandment no. 4!

8. The community is decentralized and diverse, so nobody speaks for Bitcoin except for Greg Maxwell and 3 other guys who can effectively shut down initiatives to improve the project. You think Bitcoin needs improvements? Refer to commandment no. 1!

9. If you came to Bitcoin in 2017 or later, you’re a pleb and you will always be a pleb. Be happy about it pleb, embrace the name and never question your OG overlords. 

10. It is always better to be a pleb who posts memes and “mines fiat”. What do you mean you want Bitcoin to scale to 8 billion people? Don’t you like custodial lightning? Refer to commandment no. 1 and repent, or else you’re a shitcoiner.

david bailey wants to raise $200m pac to push bitcoin to $10 million and abolish capital gains tax on btc sales,"david bailey just announced plans to raise a $100m to $200m political action committee focused entirely on advancing bitcoin interests in the us. this is the same guy who advised trump on bitcoin policy and basically orchestrated the entire political pivot that got us a pro crypto administration.

the scope of this pac is massive: bailey wants to anchor it through nakamoto holdings, his $300 million bitcoin treasury company. but the goals he outlined are way more ambitious than typical crypto lobbying. we're talking about fundamentally changing how america treats bitcoin.

primary objectives include:

pushing bitcoin price to $10 million (yes, he actually said this)

positioning bitcoin for long term dominance

abolishing capital gains tax on bitcoin sales

protecting self custody rights

legal protections for open source bitcoin developers

community suggestions are getting wild: stephan livera wants complete elimination of capital gains on btc. alex gladstein from human rights foundation is pushing for bitcoin debt payments from foreign countries, high school bitcoin education funding, and developer protection laws.

tuur demeester went even further, calling for full reserve banking requirements where banks must hold 100% of customer deposits in reserve. that would basically end fractional reserve banking as we know it.

this is different from previous crypto lobbying: fairshake pac spent $130 million in 2024 elections but focused on general crypto friendly candidates. bailey's pac would be bitcoin specific and aims to reshape fundamental economic policy around btc.

the fact that someone with direct trump administration connections is talking about $10 million bitcoin targets through political action tells you how seriously they're taking bitcoin's role in future policy.

potential concerns: charles allen from btcs warned bailey about fiduciary duty issues since he's using public company resources for political efforts. there's a real legal risk if shareholders think corporate funds are being misused for political activism.

bailey's response was that coinbase backed fairshake without issues, but allen pointed out that might not make sense in a pro crypto environment where corporate political spending isn't necessary.

the bigger picture: crypto companies spent $134 million on 2024 elections and won big. now we have elected officials who are actually pro bitcoin instead of just tolerating crypto. bailey sees this as the moment to push for structural changes while we have political momentum.

fairshake still has $141 million ready for future elections, but bailey's pac would be laser focused on bitcoin specific policy changes rather than general crypto acceptance.

what this could mean: if bailey successfully raises $200m and focuses it entirely on bitcoin policy priorities, we could see actual legislation around capital gains elimination, self custody protection, and bitcoin reserve banking requirements.

the $10 million price target isn't just speculation anymore when someone with this level of political access is building a war chest specifically to make it happen through policy changes. with tax implications changing this dramatically, tools like awaken.tax are going to become essential for tracking everything properly.

this fibonacci model has called every bitcoin move since $15k and says $166k is next...the math is actually scary accurate,"been diving into this fibonacci analysis from cryptocon and honestly, the pattern recognition is wild. this guy has been tracking btc since the ftx bottom at $15.5k and every major move has hit fibonacci extensions almost perfectly.

here's how it's played out since 2022:

$15,500 (cycle bottom after ftx collapse)

$30,362 (1.618 fib extension) - hit in april 2023, consolidation

$46,831 (2.618 extension) - hit january 2024, became support

$71,591 (3.618 extension) - touched march/june 2024, rejected twice

$109,236 (4.618 extension) - broken january 2025

next target: $166,754 (5.618 extension)

the spacing between these levels has been incredibly consistent. each leg up was around 52-54% gains before consolidation. we're currently sitting around $114k, which puts us in the transition zone between 4.618 and 5.618.

this isn't just technical hopium either:
every previous bitcoin cycle topped near specific fibonacci levels. 2013 peaked at the 5.618 extension around $1,150. 2017 hit just past 4.618 near $20k. even 2021's ""irregular"" cycle topped at $69k, which was almost exactly the 3.618 extension from 2018 lows.

the fundamental backdrop supports it:

post-halving dynamics still playing out (we're 16 months in)

etfs now hold $150b in assets (6.5% of total btc market cap)

regulatory clarity improving with genius act passing

strategic bitcoin reserve pilot program approved

but there are warning signs:
benjamin cowen points out that every post-halving year sees july/august gains followed by september corrections. we just had a 7.22% july gain, so if the pattern holds, we might see a pullback next month.

another analyst noted that profit-taking metrics are forming lower highs, suggesting each rally faces stronger selling pressure. we might get two more legs up before the cycle peaks.

what's interesting is the institutional component:
previous cycles were retail-driven. this one has blackrock holding 740k btc and institutions controlling 1 in every 15 bitcoin in circulation. that's a completely different market structure that could support higher prices.

the $166k target isn't some random moonshot number - it's where the math says we should go if this pattern continues. whether we get there in one shot or with corrections along the way is the real question.

Keep in mind people can SEE these patterns, and act accordingly, it is usually this action that makes ""this time it's different"" come true.

Markets are provably almost completely irrational.  There are small patterns, CAGE seems to have some weight, BTC has it's 'rainbow cycle', which may be real, or virtual, time will tell.  Fundamental analysis has always trumped technical tea reading over the longer term.  A mix of both could be considered prudent.

The only thing that remains the same is that when stuff falls apart everyone starts screaming ""this time it's different!!""  Funny thing is: they aren't wrong, it IS different, which is what makes it so scary.  Markets are a roller coaster, always have been, always will be.

the $112k dip might have been the best thing that happened to bitcoin... cause this setup looks too good to ignore,"just saw some interesting analysis about this weekend's btc dump to $112k and honestly, it might have been exactly what we needed. instead of freaking out about the selloff, let me break down why this could actually be setting up for a serious recovery.

the ""power of 3"" pattern is playing out perfectly: we've seen the classic accumulation phase ($119k-$115k), then manipulation (the dump to $112k), and now we might be entering distribution toward $126k. this isn't random, it's how institutional money operates while retail panics.

$922 million liquidation event cleared the deck: this was the biggest liquidation since february with $240m in btc futures alone. open interest dropped from $88b to $79b. when this much leverage gets flushed out, it removes the overhang that was keeping price suppressed.

funding rates flipped negative across exchanges: binance, bitmex, deribit all showing negative funding. that means shorts are paying longs to keep positions open. when retail is this bearish after a correction, it's usually time to start thinking contrarian.

binance taker volume hit -$1.5b: this level of aggressive selling hasn't been seen since july 25th. it's classic retail behavior - buy the top, sell the bottom. the panic selling around $114k was probably the capitulation we needed.

technical levels are lining up: the $112k-$115k zone was a major fair value gap that got filled. we bounced off the previous ath from may which is now acting as support. if we can reclaim $115.3k and $116.8k, $120k becomes a magnet with all that liquidation cluster sitting there.

why this feels different: previous corrections this cycle were about uncertainty. this one feels like a reset. leverage got flushed, weak hands got shaken out, and funding rates reset. the market structure actually looks healthier now than before the dump.

we're sitting around $114k right now but the signs are pointing toward a bounce. when you combine technical rebound signals with sentiment washing out and leverage being cleared, you get the setup for sustained moves higher.

not saying we're immediately going to $126k, but this correction might have done exactly what was needed to continue the bull market instead of ending it.

anyone else seeing similar patterns or am i just being too optimistic about what was basically a standard crypto dump?",False,0,

the $112k dip might have been the best thing that happened to bitcoin... cause this setup looks too good to ignore,"A cold wallet is an offline wallet. A hardware wallet is a wallet that breaches this gap. A cold wallet is either paper or metal, the last being the most secure and stable one over time. Electronic often fails. 

You should also consider that most hardware wallets allow online updates these days, completely negating their security.

The best in my opinion is an old PC that you never take online. Use it to generate a wallet and copy a few addresses you can send coins to, then safe the seed on metal. If you want a wallet that you can access I suggest looking into Satochip. But its not as easy as Trezor.

Also get some BCH when you have BTC.",True,4,
the $112k dip might have been the best thing that happened to bitcoin... cause this setup looks too good to ignore,"> Also, can someone please explain to me if it's possible to hold a cryptocurrency in an address without any kind of software or hardware wallet?

Of course.

Once you have generated the private key and derived the address, you or anyone you share that address with, can deposit funds on it.

As long as you don't lose the private key, you can access the funds later, you don't need to keep any specific software/hardware wallet.

This type of wallet is commonly known as a paper wallet, but you can also etch your keys into metal or whatever.",True,1,
From CFDs to real Bitcoin,"Not sure if it’s for this sub, but here we go.

A few years back, I got into BTC through eToro, but only with CFDs. At the time, it seemed the easiest way, and as a beginner, I didn’t know what spreads were, let alone that eToro’s spreads are much higher than most real crypto exchanges. I paid extra for that, but the returns have been great so I didn’t really care at the time.

Now I want to actually own my BTC. My plan is to sell the CFDs, withdraw to my bank, buy real BTC (only BTC) through an exchange, and then move it to my own wallet.

Timing is always a bit of a gamble, since I could end up selling during a local peak and buying back during a dip, or the other way around. I know there’s never a perfect moment, but I want to be in control and accept that risk.

A few things I’m still unsure about:

•	⁠Hardware wallet, or would you trust a good software wallet for long-term holding and why?
•	⁠For a EU resident, which exchange would you recommend for buying real BTC?
•	⁠Are there important things to keep in mind during this migration, like fees, taxes, timing, or risks that I might not be thinking of? For example, I’m aware that there are conversion costs when selling on eToro and moving funds to euro, plus their spread is pretty steep compared to most exchanges, and there are also network fees when sending BTC to my own wallet.
•	⁠Is there any reason not to go full self-custody, or any alternatives worth considering?

I’d really appreciate practical advice or experiences from people who have made this switch or expert in these matters. Obviously I will not answer to PM’s.

Thanks!",False,1,
From CFDs to real Bitcoin,"Get some coins and try all this stuff until you are comfortable with. For now fees are low so testing is cheap. To many people buy and transfer once and have no idea what they are doing and are super anxious about it. 

Hardware wallets are NEVER a secure storage. Electronic fails all the time. A Cold wallet in Paper or Metal is consideres safe. A Hardware wallets job is to bridge that gap when you want access to your coins.


While you are at it, also get some working Bitcoin: BCH for comparison. Works better and cheaper to test and wallet tech wise it is basically the same. Bonus: can still be transferred when BTC has another congestion.",True,3,

I started yesterday to accumulate the second Bitcoin.

Who else is here is part of the 1 bitcoin club!",False,388,🐻 Bearish
Finally 1 bitcoin!,"I can tell you are new here so I'll let you know a few things.

1. never post info that makes you a target like this.  I know you are saying you don't reply to DMs, but it goes much further than that.  If people know you have enough value they can extort, there are people out there who will social engineer to figure out who you are and any way they can possibly steal that money from you.  You aren't as safe as you think you are just because you won't get phished.

2. this is the btc subreddit which is primarily a bitcoin cash subreddit.  This is a very complicated thing for a new person to understand, but essentially the r/bitcoin subreddit was heavily censored prior to the hard fork and people who wanted to have a real conversation about small vs big blocks came here to talk.  People here aren't fans of the bitcoin that 99% of people call bitcoin

3.  congrats on the investment, I don't meant to be attacking you, just trying to help out.  Diversify into other cryptos.  Bitcoin has it's place in the world, but the rest of the world will catch up eventually and understand that there is more to crypto than a store of value.  Real utility is what will drive the future of crypto.
