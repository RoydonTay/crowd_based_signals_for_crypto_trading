63% BTC and climbing… everything else feels like dead weight,"Just checked my portfolio and the trend is crystal clear:

Tried Bitcoin mining without the noisy rigs — my first experience with GoMining,"I’ve always been curious about Bitcoin mining, but I live in a tiny apartment and my landlord probably wouldn’t be thrilled if I installed a rack of screaming GPUs.

A friend suggested I look into GoMining — instead of running your own rig, you basically “rent” hashing power from their data centers. I was skeptical at first, but the idea of mining without the heat, noise, and electric bill was appealing.

What I liked so far:
• No hardware to buy or maintain (I’ve blown up enough PC fans in my life)
• You can start with a small amount — I began with just enough to see if it actually works
• Daily payouts straight to your wallet

• Long-term ROI — with BTC prices swinging, I want to see how it does over a few months
• Fees and payout schedules — it’s not “free money,” but neither is running a rig at home

Value of money as a function of fees needed to use it,"Think about it.

Ideal money that you don't need to pay fees to use, transfers the full value on every transaction.

Physically, the closest we have come to that is __cash__, although that also suffers from some costs imposed by the issuers (incl. inflation, ""the hidden tax"") and wear & tear on the physical media (coins or paper).

Electronically, since Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of blockchains, we have more options, ranging from chains where you pay zero/almost zero fees to chains which may have high fees per transaction.

The value you get out of your coins is related to the amount of fees you need to pay to spend them.

If you end up needing to spend all your money on fees, the value of those coins to you is:

0.

(same if the fees to spend would exceed your holdings)

btc hits $122k and analysts are looking at $125k...where's the next resistance?,"bitcoin just touched $122,230 today after being stuck around $112k last week. that's a 65% gain from the april lows if anyone's keeping track. now citi analysts are talking $125k targets, but the real question is what happens after we break current resistance levels.

right now btc is testing the $123,200 all-time high as immediate resistance. this level held back previous attempts and there's likely selling pressure from people who bought the previous peak.

if we clear $123,200 convincingly, the next psychological resistance hits at $125,000. round numbers always create resistance as traders take profits and institutions rebalance portfolios.

but here's where it gets interesting, after $125k, the next major resistance zone doesn't appear until around $135k-$140k. that's roughly where fibonacci extensions and previous cycle patterns suggest institutional selling might emerge.

$135k-$140k range: this aligns with fibonacci extension levels from previous cycles. also where some models predict institutional profit-taking could emerge as bitcoin reaches roughly 15% of gold's market cap.

$150k psychological barrier: another round number that creates natural resistance. at this level, bitcoin's market cap would approach $3 trillion, putting it closer to microsoft or apple territory.

$160k-$175k zone: based on logarithmic trend channels, this range represents where previous bull market extensions have typically peaked before major corrections. For traders navigating these levels, especially those with significant gains to track, services like awaken.tax can help manage the complexity of crypto tax reporting as positions move through these resistance zones.

They see an asset going up faster than anything else they've seen before and they want some of that growth. Sure you have some altruists, but the feeling I get is most accessible coin is held by folks who think they are investing, not participating in some social/financial experiment.

Edit: Since 'altruistic' appears to inspire debate, I'll provide a definition for my usage. In this context altruistic means being motivated not by the benefit one might receive themselves but by the benefit others might receive. It's intimately tied to intent.

It's defined in the OED dictionary as ""the belief in or practice of disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others.""

To clarify, wanting security and decentralization because you think it's going to make the world better for everyone around you is altruistic. Wanting security and decentralization because someone told you btc provides it and that's the way you can get rich, or save your purchasing power, that's not altruistic. It may create outcomes for others which are beneficial, but acting on motivations of self-interest, with the intent of personal benefit, would be decided not altruistic under this definition.

Does BTC need future proofing?,"Bitcoin’s security depends on people actually using it not just storing it.

Does BTC need future proofing?,"Arguing about 'store of value' versus 'payment system' doesn't matter, when Bitcoin with Lightning solves both. Here's a nice video about the topic, especially with the longer term view: https://youtu.be/aWtzOQTv8Dc?si=Nfq4rJZuv9gSR1Xh

Lightning in the solution to scaling the payments. (Later in this comment, I mention other systems; Bitcoin is not relying exclusively on Lightning)

It's ""trustless"" in the sense that your Lightning payments are as safe as the on-chain payments. I.e. there is zero risk to you, if you follow the process correctly, _even if everyone else on Lightning tries to steal your money_

There is no limit on the number of transactions that Lightning can handle. One on-chain transaction is needed to onboard a new user (i.e. Lightning wallet), but typically a user can then proceed with thousands of Lightning transactions without requiring any new more on-chain transactions.

Imagine 100,000 users joining each day for a year. After a year, assuming each just makes 10 transactions per day, we will have 365,000,000 transactions per day. Lightning handles this easily, with instant trustless transactions.

No other Bitcoin-related system can do this. For example, Bitcoin Cash has not presented any plan for handling hundreds of millions of transactions per day, despite having had eight years to plan for this.

You might be wondering why Lightning isn't so visible yet in the ""real world"". As bitcoin is still vastly underpriced, many people who understand Bitcoin are hoarding it instead of spending it. But that will change gradually as the economic incentives change.

So basically, Lightning is ready and is already in heavy use behind the scenes, and there are plenty of smart people working on similar systems (the Ark Protocol is another Layer 2 for Bitcoin, which can work separately from - or can interact with - Lightning) to fill all the various tradeoffs (speed, trust, fee minimisation, ..). The economics aren't yet driving people to use massive adoption, but they gradually will.

Eth vs Btc: What is the reality?,"So eth just hit its highest weekly close since 2021 at 4,300. The ETH/BTC ratio doubled from its April low, and suddenly everyone's asking if Bitcoin is losing market share. but whats the reality?

i caught two takes today that got me thinking:

first, Samson Mow argues the recent eth rally is fueled by bitcoin holders rotating capital into eth for short-term gain...only to dump it once prices get high enough and shift profits back into btc. he calls this the “bagholder’s dilemma.” current eth/btc ratio is around 0.036, double its april low, but he warns eth faces a sell-off once it hits key psychological levels

Secomd, Willy Woo called Bitcoin the ""perfect asset for the next 1000 years"" - and looking at longer timeframes, the fundamentals remain unchanged. Bitcoin's market cap is still only 11% of gold's $23 trillion, meaning we're far from complete adoption.

The real question isn't whether ETH can pump another 12% to hit its ATH. It's whether Bitcoin continues building toward becoming a world reserve asset. And for that to happen, we need way more capital flowing in.

in short term flows, eth sees spikes from traders chasing yield, but profits often rotate back to btc

in long tem confidrence, btc remains the default store of value

in short, btc isn’t losing its dominance, capital flow dynamics shift over cycles, but fundamentals still favor bitcoin for many institutions. eth can rally within those windows, but its staying power depends on sustained narratives, not just hype.

either way, if you're actively trading between eth and btc or taking profits on these moves, platforms like awaken.tax become pretty essential for tracking cost basis across all the swaps and rotations.",False,1,🤔 Opinion

"They don't need a CBDC if they can get a network of centralized ""stablecoins""","Centralized stablecoins offer the main features of CBDCs:

- Can be printed (inflated) as necessary (ask Tether)
- Can be mass surveilled (most are transparent blockchains lacking any privacy features and require users to perform KYC/AML i.e. to definitively identify themselves to the operators)
- Can be controlled (funds frozen, transactions blocked, conditions on spending enforced by the operators of centralized & permissioned stablecoins)

As such, they may _look_ like cryptocurrency to the lay public, but they are closer to a distributed form of CBDC.

In the case of centralized USD stablecoins, one could say they together form a ""synthetic CBDC"" even though the central banks (like the Fed in this case) have maintained separation distance for plausible deniability. Because the concept of CBDCs has deservedly gotten a bad reputation already, esp. after a few central bankers and elites essentially dropped hints of why they favored such systems over the legacy banking/money structures.

__Does this mean stablecoins are generally bad?__

In my opinion, no.

There can be __decentralized stablecoins__ that do not require particular trusted intermediaries and do not need to suffer from the type of surveillance and control problems associated with centralized ones.

Such decentralized stablecoins are closer to the idea of p2p cash than to fiat money, and can bring Bitcoin's default level of pseudonymity plus, if suitable mixed (perhaps with something similar to CashFusion), they could enhance privacy beyond what Bitcoin can offer.

how close are we to bitcoin hitting new ath this week? $142k possible?,"saw merlijn's bitcoin bull run cheat sheet and some analysis suggesting btc might actually break to new highs within days. wanted to break down what i'm seeing here.

current situation: btc sitting around $118,500 after bouncing from $112k support. the chart shows we're potentially in the final accumulation phase before the next major move up.

technical setup looks interesting:

formed a bullish flag pattern since june 22nd when we bottomed at $98k and peaked at the $123k ath

flag has a height of about $25k, which typically projects to around $142k if we break above $117k resistance

already showing signs of breaking above the upper flag boundary

holding above 100-day ema and completed a break-and-retest at the $112k level

what's driving this potential move:

etf inflows jumped $246m last week after bleeding $643m the week before

exchange supply at multi-year lows while demand keeps increasing

fed rate cut probability rising after weak jobs data

cpi data coming tuesday could be the catalyst if it comes in weak

the cycle timing also matches historical patterns. looking at merlijn's chart, we've had bear phases lasting 1300-1500 days followed by accumulation periods of around 1400 days. if the pattern holds, we should be transitioning into the actual bull run phase right about now.

if we do hit those targets, gonna be interesting to see how the tax implications play out. platforms like awaken.tax are probably gonna see a surge in activity as people try to figure out their gains on what could be some pretty wild moves.

rsi crossed above 50, macd turning bullish, momentum building. feels like we're setting up for either a major breakout or a significant rejection at these levels.

what's your take? are we actually ready for $142k or is this just another false breakout before more consolidation? the technical setup seems solid but crypto has a way of doing the opposite of what everyone expects.",False,0,⌨ Discussion

"MicroStrategy has accumulated 600k BTC by taking on tens of billions of dollars in loans and debt.BCHG fund has acquired 400k BCH through straightforward purchases, with no debt or leverage. BCH shares the same supply scarcity as Bitcoin, investors are betting on its potential growth trajectory.","Grayscale's Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG) has acquired 391,239 BCH through outright purchases, calculated as 0.00830246 BCH per share multiplied by 47,123,300 shares: [https://www.grayscale.com/funds/grayscale-bitcoin-cash-trust](https://www.grayscale.com/funds/grayscale-bitcoin-cash-trust) 

  


In contrast, MicroStrategy holds 628k BTC, but its average purchase price is continually increasing due to new leveraged purchases. This approach creates a risk of liquidation overhang, as the company will eventually need to repay its debts. Should BTC experience a significant crash, instead of facing insolvency, the company might be forced to either use customer-held Bitcoin assets to settle debts or to drastically increase its share count. The latter action would dilute the value for current shareholders, effectively transferring majority ownership to its creditors: [https://saylortracker.com/](https://saylortracker.com/) 



The Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG) is a ""clean"" investment vehicle that acquires BCH without using debt, representing a passive exposure trust for buyers.



In stark contrast, MicroStrategy, a company with limited software business growth, uses a leveraged strategy to acquire Bitcoin. It funds its purchases with debt and new share issuances. This approach amplifies returns but also introduces risk; a significant market crash could force the company to liquidate its Bitcoin holdings to cover debts or drastically dilute its shares, making them nearly worthless for existing investors.



While MicroStrategy's large-scale purchases are often cited for creating Bitcoin's supply scarcity, BCHG's accumulation of hundreds of thousands of BCH suggests a similar dynamic is at play with Bitcoin Cash. Both assets share a hard cap of 21 million units, and some argue that as BCH is continually absorbed by buyers like BCHG, the market may eventually realize this scarcity, potentially leading to sharp price increases as available supply on exchanges dwindles.

Banking worldwide (including branches, ATMs, networks etc) is about 260TWH per year 

Visa alone has an average TPS of 1700 so if that used all of the 260TWH, that's just over 1kwh per transaction which is 700 times less than bitcoin and that's just one payment processor.

this btc chart pattern looks exactly like before the 70k to 108k moonshot,"been staring at the charts all morning and stumbled across some analysis that's got me pretty bullish. trader galaxy just dropped some comparison charts showing btc is literally copying the same pattern that led to those massive gains in late 2024.

remember that run from 70k to 108k? apparently we're sitting in almost the exact same spot right now. btc is doing this support retest thing where it broke through a trendline and now it's coming back to test that line as support. last time this happened, price discovery mode kicked in and we rocketed straight up.

galaxy posted on twitter saying ""last time it looked like this it was before the run from 70k to 100k."" the setup is almost identical - btc breaks resistance, pulls back to retest it as support, then if it holds we get liftoff.

now obviously it's not a perfect copy. this time the trendline is ascending instead of descending, and we've got all this macro stuff with trade tariffs messing with risk assets. but the structure is remarkably similar.

what's really interesting is the swing low pattern galaxy spotted. we hit swing lows in april and june, and both times those levels held as the bottom - never got revisited. friday we briefly dipped below 112k for another swing low. if history repeats, that might be our floor.

another thing - analysts are saying btc probably won't repeat that nasty 30% dump we saw after hitting aths earlier this year. instead they're looking at that 109.3k january peak as ultimate support. so even if we do go lower, we're not talking about a major crash.

honestly this whole sideways action we've been in feels like accumulation before the next leg up. reduced volatility, consolidation around these levels, institutions still buying the dip. classic btc behavior before it decides to move violently in one direction.

if we do get another major run like the 70k to 108k move, anyone actively trading these swings should probably start thinking about tax implications early. tracking cost basis and timing becomes way more important when you're looking at potential 50%+ gains, especially with all the talk about possible capital gains changes. tools like awaken.tax can help keep everything organized before things get crazy again.

the consensus seems to be that btc is going to pick a direction soon after weeks of this boring price action. if this pattern comparison holds up, that direction might be straight up.

what do you guys think? are you seeing the same similarities in the charts? or is this just hopium disguised as technical analysis?

personally i'm keeping my dca going and watching that support level closely. if it holds and we start pushing higher, this could be the setup for another 50% run.",False,0,

🧵 Bitcoin Chain Selection: Who Wins in a Fork?,"Ever wonder how Bitcoin picks the “real” chain when there’s a split?
It doesn’t count blocks. It picks the chain with the most proof of work.

Let’s say there’s a fork:
Chain A adds 1 block at the old, tougher difficulty.
Chain B adds 2 blocks, but after a difficulty drop.
Which one wins?

Not the longer one. The heavier one.

Bitcoin adjusts mining difficulty every ~2 weeks to keep block times around 10 minutes.
If blocks are coming in too slow, the difficulty drops. That makes mining easier.

Say the difficulty falls by a third.
Now 1 old-difficulty block = 3 units of work.
Each new-difficulty block = 1 unit of work.

So:
Chain A = 1 × 3 = 3 units
Chain B = 2 × 1 = 2 units

Even though it’s shorter, Chain A wins. More work = more weight.

Bitcoin doesn’t care about who got there first or who added more blocks.
It cares who did more work. That’s the chain the network follows.

You’ve gotta put in the hash 💪

🧵 Bitcoin Chain Selection: Who Wins in a Fork?,"> Ever wonder how Bitcoin picks the “real” chain when there’s a split?

That's only partly correct and highly depends on what you mean by fork.


For example if there are two blocks mined at the same time they compete for the being the actual chain and chain header. Some other miner will find a block on top of one of them and all miners will realign themselves onto the new ""most work"" blockchain header. In this case you are correct. This works because all the miners follow the same ruleset. 


In the other case where there is a chain split, two rulesets exists for the creation of the next block and nakamoto consensus cannot tell you which ruleset is the ""right"" one. Miners have to choose which ruleset they follow and support with their hash and people have to decide which ruleset is ""their"" chain. 

In case of the BCH/BTC split, people were let to believe that hashrate is all that matters and that let to false believes like yours. But there are a multitude of things that one needs to consider. Imagine BTC split into BTC and NEWBTC and the old BTC implemented tail emission. Since it pays miners more its hashrate would be greater but would you consider it Bitcoin?

Imagine 100,000 users each day start using some form of Bitcoin, and each of those makes ten transactions every day from the day they are onboarded.

After one year, that means 365,000,000 million transactions per day. Bitcoin Cash obviously can't support that, especially as they refuse to put Lightning on top of their Bitcoin Cash chain. **Bitcoin Cash would crash and burn within days of trying to onboard these users**.

Bitcoin _with Lightning_ solves this. It takes only one on-chain transaction, typically costing about $1, to onboard the user. After they are onboarded, they can make essentially unlimited transactions

Lightning transactions are instant. And they are instantly confirmed; i.e. they are fully ""trustless"". Lightning balances are _not_ IOUs. You can always move your Lightning balance onto the chain _even if nobody else cooperates and if they try to steal your funds_

By contrast, it takes roughly ten minutes (at the least) to have any confidence that a Bitcoin Cash transaction has completed

In short, the BCH has had 8 years to deploy Lightning, or some suitable alternative if they think they can do better, to deliver huge numbers of instant, trustless, transactions. But they haven't even tried

The Math of Cracking Missing Seed Words,"I recently released a new free and Creative Commons licensed [tutorial](https://youtu.be/R9IP5dLghzA) on the math of cracking missing seed words. I created a tool for calculating the number of missing bits, possible combinations, and estimated cracking times for pros and consumers.

One of the interesting things that I found is that the last word being included in the missing words makes a decent difference in the overall combinations and crack times for up to around 3 missing words, since the 4 to 8 checksum bits aren't included in the cracking operations.

TL;DR for about 1-3 missing words, cracking/recovering is possible and fairly likely. Once you get to 4-5 words, it becomes impractical or impossible. Anything above 6 and definitely a full seed is impossible.

indonesia might add bitcoin to reserves and it’s hitting my mindset,"i’ve been following the crypto space for years and even i’m a bit stunned that indonesia’s vice president office is exploring bitcoin as a national reserve asset. they met with Bitcoin Indonesia, pitched mining using their hydro and geothermal power, and even mentioned allocating around $18 billion to btc holdings

they also talked about education initiatives and long term value...citing forecasts like $13 million per bitcoin by 2045

i’m honestly conflicted. part of me feels proud, this could legitimize bitcoin at a national level like no other. but another part of me is cautious, they still ban crypto payments, enforcement is inconsistent, and taxes on trading and mining have doubled recently

here’s what i keep thinking:

a government seriously considering btc for reserves isn’t hype. it's strategic.

indonesia has massive renewable energy...mining makes sense on paper.

but the math still scares me...$18b equals roughly 200 000 btc. that’s serious exposure.

i can’t afford to get too excited because there's still risk. policy can flip. enforcement might tighten. or the public education push could fall flat.

yet if it happens..if indonesia pushes forward, it might shift the sentiment globally. could trigger other nations to rethink reserve strategy. could boost btc just by signaling long term institutional trust.

from where i sit i’m holding. i might average in more if this escalates into actual policy. worst case it fizzles, btc stays sideways, taxes stay high, and regulations stay tight. best case indonesia opens the floodgates. btw make sure you're tracking everything properly for taxes been using awaken.tax to keep all my staking rewards and trades organized",False,0,⌨ Discussion

"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.","Fun Facts:

BTC, BSV or BCH security models are largely equivalent.   
  
By design, Bitcoins security model scales to:

1. The number of network participants using the network (aka Metcalfe's law) is instrumental in security.
2. Bitcoin's security subsidy shrinks over time to marginal cost to secure the network from point 1. above.
3. While the security subsidy depletes over time, security is transitioned to secure the average value transacted on the network.  **IE.** as the miners are paid to secure the network without subsidized security, they are dependent on transaction fees. Because transacting is optional and not guaranteed, miners in a free market are expected to encourage and optimize for high-volume and maximum revenue, aka economies of scale that are dependent on the network and network effect from point 1.
4. A tangent security benefit is safety in large numbers or the Oddity Effect, obfuscation the networks transactions leaving governments with the only option to follow the money when a crime is committed as opposed to blanket KYC legislation that moots privacy linking identity to transactions, in an age where AI can track everything. again point 1 the larger the number of transactions the greater the network effect the more secure the network is.

Both BCH and BTC for the most part retain these design features and are 100% equivalent.  
**The bottom line**, security of most forks of the Bitcoin ledger is equivalent and proportional to the perceived value of the token.

While BTC has a greater network effect, it is limited in transaction capacity, allowing KYC touchpoints with trusted third parties to link the majority of transactions with participants identity. Ultimately leaving BTC with an inferior security model to BCH.

"If you want to claim BTC's security model is superior, let's talk about it.",">**Can you explain the ""security model"" you are talking about?**

Security is a complex issue. It is foolish to restrict it to just a subset of the important properties. Some of the known and discussed BTC security issues:

* Security in the sense of certainty that transactions will be registered in the blockchain.
   * This has already become an issue, since there are more transactions coming than the network can store in the blockchain. BTC's ""security solution"" is to ignore the transactions that exceed the network limit. This is not really secure and it will exacerbate other issues.
* Security in the sense of certainty that an attacker will be unable to find the signature for some UTXO's he does not own.
   * It is well known (an algorithm has already been written) how to brute-force a signature for some coins provided one owns a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. The only obstacle is, that the existing quantum computers are not powerful enough.
   * When sufficiently powerful quantum computers will be developed, the only secure solution will be to switch to quantum-resistant signatures. This will have several security implications
      * It is known that a quantum-resistant signature will require a multiple of data sufficient for its quantum-unsecure counterpart. This will negatively affect the transaction throughput, lowering the likelihood that a transaction will be registered in the blockchain.
      * All UTXO's will have to be transformed from the existing quantum-unsecure form to a form using a quantum-resistant signature. This transformation will be a very demanding operation requiring billions of quantum-secure transactions to be registered in short time, which, as we know, the BTC network is not secure to do.",True,2,⌨ Discussion

I’d also stop following advice from people on here, there’s a concerning amount of people in this Reddit thread who still play with fiat crap and haven’t done nearly enough reading into bitcoin. If you have a bunch of free time I’d be reading like a mad man so you can get to the point to not care about cycles because bitcoin is bitcoin no matter the fist price.

I’d also be spreading my bitcoin across wallets or getting super into multi sig or something. Something you know you can manage.

I’d would recommend either now or after spending some time with some heavy hitter books like the price of tomorrow, the big print, figuring out who’s to diversity atleast in the same asset class and arguing with chat I’d even that’s a good idea over buying just bitcoin.
