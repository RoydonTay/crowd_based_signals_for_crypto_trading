Ethereum Close to All-Time Highs — Altcoin Season Loading?,"Hey everyone,

Over the last few days, the charts have been buzzing. Ethereum is now pushing towards the $4,000 mark, just a few hundred dollars shy of its all-time highs. If ETH breaks through, history tells us that altcoin season could follow quickly.

Here’s what I’m watching:

Bitcoin holding strong above $150K, stability is a green light for alt growth.

Ethereum only ~$500 away from ATH, breakout potential is huge.

Altcoins like XRP starting to show signs of life, but the real momentum is yet to come.

	
REM Token (RWA-focused microcap), A play on the tokenization of real-world assets, available on MEXC.

RWA sector as a whole is booming,tokenized real estate, gold, and commodities are gaining traction, especially with increasing regulatory clarity (even the US is opening up crypto for retirement plans).

Lost 90% on TRUMP meme coin — should I HODL or cut my losses,"
Back in Jan 2025, I invested ₹10k ($120) in TRUMP meme coin at around $60–$70 each (about 2 coins). Now it’s sitting at ~$9 — worth less than $18 total.

With US election hype possible later this year but Trump facing negative news globally, I’m wondering: sell now for pennies or hold in hope of a $30–$60 rebound?

"After 5 Years in Crypto Trading, I Finally ""Made It"" - Here's What Actually Worked","I started trading crypto in 2018. Like many, I got in with zero experience, thinking I’d get rich fast. Spoiler: I didn’t.

Bought TRX, XRP, and a bunch of random altcoins. Lost $2,700 in a few months. Then I tried margin trading (big mistake), got liquidated, and was left staring at an empty account. Honestly, I almost quit.

In 2019, I decided to stop gambling and start learning. I studied charts, watched real traders, read books, and backtested strategies. I didn’t trade real money for a while—just practiced and journaled everything.

By 2020, I was finally making small profits. Took only setups I trusted, avoided hype, and managed risk properly. Made around $4,800 on a $3K account. Nothing crazy, but it felt earned.

2021 bull run? I was ready. I grew my account to over $43K trading ETH, SOL, and a few strong alts. But I got cocky, messed with leverage again, and gave back a chunk. That lesson hurt, but it stuck.

2022 was survival mode. I traded less, avoided trying to “buy the dip,” and focused on capital preservation. Profits were small, but I didn’t lose.

From 2023 to now, I’ve kept it boring: 1% risk per trade, only 2–3 reliable setups, and strict journaling. I don’t trade every day. I don’t chase pumps. I just stick to what works.

In 2024, I crossed $100K in my trading account. No moonshots. Just consistency over time.

TL;DR

Lost money in 2018 (like most beginners) Started learning & tracking everything in 2019 Profitable by 2020, stayed consistent Bull run helped, but greed punished me in 2021 Focused on capital protection in 2022 2023–2025: steady growth, no drama Finally passed $100K in 2024 Biggest Lessons:

You won’t get rich overnight. Risk management > everything. You don’t need to trade every day. Journaling your trades = free edge. Survive long enough, and your edge will show up. Happy to answer questions if anyone’s stuck in the early phase like I was. Stay in the game.",False,26,Sentiment

I suspect this run and perhaps the next one are still in the FOMO and narrative phase of crypto, not the tech and utility phase...yet. People just lose their mind in the euphoric phase and throw money at narratives. That's ok. I'm ready.

Ironically, Bitcoin is now mostly cherished for its utility (store of value) so there's that.

With Revolut, you won't own the cryptos for sure, but you also won't with any other crypto exchange unless you transfer to a cold wallet.

BTC is just made a close to 2x on it's previous ATH while ETH isn't even at previous ATH yet.  Tokenization of RWA's, stablecoins, regulatory clarity until at least 2028, staking rewards owners of ETH, all these things are my reasons.

"If you had to go ALL IN on ONE coin until 2030, what’s your pick?","I wanted to share something I have been looking into after reading the SEC’s CorpFin note from August 5. They explained that when an on chain protocol handles everything through code with no middleman and no one holding your keys and simply mints or redeems tokens programmatically it is generally not considered a securities offering unless the setup itself is an investment contract.

That got me thinking about a project called Datamine. It is not staking in the traditional sense but it follows that same programmatic no intermediary model. You hold your own DAM tokens lock them in a contract and they mint FLUX over time. You can burn FLUX or ArbiFLUX to increase your future mint rate and all of this is coded into the contract with no one changing the rules on you. The LOCK token is designed to keep liquidity in the system long term and there is Arbitrum support so it is affordable to use.

What I found interesting is the approach to inflation. In most systems inflation just eats away at value. Here you can use it to your advantage by burning tokens to boost your own emissions turning inflation into something you can control rather than something that controls you.

Not financial advice but worth a look if you are interested in different tokenomics models that match the SEC’s programmatic no intermediary description.",True,2,DISCUSSION

Relationship of BTC to ETH,"Ethereum is currently trading at roughly 1/27th the price of Bitcoin, which is near a historical low for their ratio. Historically, the average ETH/BTC ratio has been closer to 1/17, which would imply an ETH price of around €6,000 today if it reverted to the mean. At its all-time high ratio in 2017, ETH was about 1/6th the price of Bitcoin, which in today’s terms would put it near €15,000.

Given this huge disparity, you’d think the market would recognize the undervaluation and rotate capital from BTC into ETH, especially as we approach the part of the cycle where altcoins typically outperform. Yet the rotation hasn’t happened in force .Isnt it curious? ",False,9,SENTIMENT

The Honest Truth About the Bull Market,"Everyone loves the hype, the green candles, and the we’re all gonna make it energy.

The Honest Truth About the Bull Market,"It's truly sad seeing all the permabulls who only advocate buying and holding with no risk management strategy at all. Their entire concept is just trying to find a larger fool to sell to. Crypto has been in an irrational and aggressively speculative market for the last 15+ years, supported by global macroeconomic conditions (the Everything Bubble). The only ""intrinsic value"", if you really even want to call it that, is from criminal use cases. Otherwise, all crypto is truly worthless. 

These people who have been conditioned like pavlovian dogs will be buying every dip all the way from $116k to <$,1000 and anyone who is over leveraged will be margin called/go bankrupt. Doesn't matter if you have an unrealized gain of 10,000% if you never realize it and watch it reverse into unrealized losses. And this can happen much, much, much faster than most of these people think is even possible. 

Personally, I think the BTC ATH is already in at \~$123k and will collapse to <$1,000 as we go into this next bear market.",True,-10,

Eth is that proven L1 backbone that banks and others are chosing. (bitcoin doesn’t have smart contracts, other cryptos aren’t as proven/trusted.)

While eth’s USD price has been pumping, it is still very much lagging on its ETHBTC pairing.  It has a long way to go to catch up to the value it once had when compared to bitcoin.

This is partly why you see bitcoin kind of stuck at its current level while we have an ethusd break to the upside.  It has a long way to go still, but the narrative has recently changed in its favor.

What is a hard wallet,"you don't want to keep your coins on an exchange, not your keys not your coins. It is better to self custody. The best option for this is to use a hardware wallet because it securely stores your private keys, they never leave the device. This is more secure than storing it on a computer. There is already tons of more information available on reddit, Youtube, etc.",True,6,Tool
What is a hard wallet,"A lot of use choose to use hardware wallets because it gives you full control over your assets. It's the same thing as having cash in your wallet or cash in your bank.

  
Buying and holding on coinbase is fine if you trust them with your money.",True,6,Tool
What is a hard wallet,"You can totally just keep your stuff on Coinbase. Problem is, exchanges are hacking targets and many have been hacked in the past. Or worse, the developers of the exchange engineered a fake hack and stole users’ tokens. 

While I do think Coinbase is probably the safest exchange out there, you can still make a mistake and get yourself hacked and your wallet drained. Coinbase offers no reimbursement if you get yourself hacked. If Coinbase gets hacked, there is some coverage because their USD pool gets stored at banks basically, which are fdic insured. But that won’t cover any tokens you have. 

Once you are moving into coins that aren’t on Coinbase, like for instance getting on MetaMask and swapping or trading on other smaller exchanges, you might find yourself putting money in places that… aren’t as trustful. That’s when you want to start consolidating.

If you can trust yourself to not lose your keys or click on bad smart contract links, then self custody through a hard wallet. If you don’t trust yourself or coinbase, then sell all your tokens and buy ETFs. Otherwise I think Coinbase or binance are fine. 

Some people believe that self custody is the whole point, but I’m just trying to explain this from the perspective I think will help you",True,3,Tool
What is a hard wallet,"And an example I made here before. My exchange was KuCoin...last year I had a lot on the exchange, playing around with memecoins as well as larger coinage.

What is a hard wallet,The exchange is a place you want to keep crypto that you plan to sell within a reasonable timeframe. I’ll keep some alt coins on there since I might sell in a month or two. Bitcoin I put away and forget so it’s going to my cold wallet since I won’t access it often if at all for long periods. It’s also good to have a limit of how much you keep on an exchange.

"XRP sentiment shift, too much noise or quiet breakout in the making?","Something’s definitely cooking with XRP lately, and it’s not just price action.  
Between steady on-chain activity, a rise in institutional mentions, and a noticeable uptick in social volume (especially from accounts that usually ignore XRP), I feel like we’re heading into one of those classic XRP pre-breakout phases.

I’m not saying we’re about to 10x next week, but the relative silence compared to the rest of the market feels… intentional. Sort of like how SOL was being accumulated low-key before it ran. Same energy here.

I’ve held XRP through all the noise, FUD, and lawsuits - and honestly I’ve never seen the market this evenly split between indifference and quiet conviction. I’ve personally decided to reposition part of my XRP holdings into yield, just to make use of the lull.

For those interested, I recently moved some XRP to Nexo, where they’re running a 5% XRP-back promo, and optionally offering up to 12% APR if you stake. I’m not going heavy on staking, but the bonus was a no-brainer since I was rotating wallets anyway.

"Tucker Carlson, the ""Most Dangerous Economist,"" and the Secret Engine of Our Misery. Dr. Richard Werner laid bare the machinery of inflation, war, and inequality. He may not have said the word ""Bitcoin,"" but he built its most compelling case.","Tucker Carlson, the ""Most Dangerous Economist,"" and the Secret Engine of Our Misery.  
  
Dr. Richard Werner laid bare the machinery of inflation, war, and inequality. He may not have said the word ""Bitcoin,"" but he built its most compelling case.  
  
Every so often, a conversation slices through the static of our daily news cycle and strikes at the very foundation of our reality. It doesn't just present new facts; it provides a new lens through which to see the world, revealing that the chaos we experience isn't random but a product of a hidden design. Tucker Carlson's recent interview with Dr. Richard Werner was one such moment.  
  
Werner, a German economist with a quiet demeanor that belies the explosive nature of his work, has been labeled by some as “the most dangerous economist in the world.” Why? His core thesis doesn't just challenge a specific policy or critique a political party. It dynamites the entire bedrock of modern banking and economics, exposing the system for what it is: a mechanism of control, engineered for specific outcomes.  
  
Throughout the conversation, Werner methodically dismantled the comforting lies we are told about money. The result was a chillingly clear picture of how inflation, perpetual war, and crushing inequality are not unfortunate byproducts of a complex system, but rather the intended output of its engine. And in doing so, whether he intended to or not, he erected the single greatest billboard for Bitcoin imaginable. He described the disease in such perfect detail that the cure became self-evident.

* **Positive Crypto News:** The video highlights what is considered ""the biggest news of all time for crypto,"" mentioning major developments related to Trump's administration, XRP, and Ethereum.
* **Trump Administration's Executive Orders:** The video discusses two executive orders signed by President Trump that are seen as beneficial for the crypto community. The first is an order guaranteeing fair banking for all Americans, which prevents the denial of banking services based on political beliefs or lawful business practices. This is framed as a reversal of ""Operation Chokepoint 2.0"" from the Biden administration. The second order allows over 90 million American workers to access alternative assets, including digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, in their 401k retirement accounts. The host claims this could open up $12 trillion in new potential money for the crypto market.
* **Market Analysis and Predictions:**
    * **Bitcoin:** The video notes a positive pump for Bitcoin following the news and discusses technical indicators, such as the 20-day EMA and the MACD, which suggest a potential bullish crossover and a push toward new all-time highs.
    * **Altcoins:** The host suggests it's ""altcoin's time now,"" anticipating a shift from Bitcoin dominance to altcoins like XRP and ETH.
* **XRP and Ripple's Case:** The video reports that the SEC vs. Ripple case is officially over, which is seen as a victory for Ripple and the crypto community. The host speculates that this resolution could pave the way for BlackRock to file for an iShares XRP ETF.
* **Ethereum Developments:**
    * **Devs' Commitment to Scaling:** The video praises Ethereum developers for committing to a roadmap that will scale the main chain to 10x its current capacity within the next year, aiming for 10,000 transactions per second.
    * **Institutional Interest:** The host notes a recent surge in institutional interest in Ethereum, citing a new treasury company, Fundamental Global Incorporated, that plans to raise $5 billion to buy ETH.
* **Other Crypto Assets:** The video also briefly covers other cryptocurrencies:
    * **Solana (SOL):** Noted for breaking out of a downtrend line, with a MACD bull cross expected soon.

My planned crypto portfolio – looking for feedback,"Hey everyone,

I’m putting together a simple long-term crypto portfolio, weighted by current market capitalization.  
Here’s the breakdown:

* **BTC** – 72.0%
* **ETH** – 15%
* **XRP** – 6%
* **BNB** – 3%
* **SOL** – 3%
* **TRX** – 1.0%

The idea is to mirror the market cap distribution among these top coins. I’ll rebalance periodically — if market caps shift significantly, the allocation will adjust accordingly.

Does Tokenizing the Newport landfill makes sense?,"James Howells, an IT worker from South Wales, had used his laptop to 'mine' \~ 8000 units of digital Bitcoin currency in 2009. He was the one of only 5 miners in 2009. In 2010, the Dell XPS N1710 broke after he spilt lemonade on it, so he dismantled the computer  for parts, kept the drive in a desk drawer and later binned it.

That hardrive is now sitting at Newport landfill somewhere buried under 25,000 cubic meters of waste and earth"", weighing approximately 110,000–200,000 tonnes. To give you the scale, it could be anywhere beneath an area of rubbish the size of a football pitch.

Now, as per the latest news, the landfill site is set to permanently close in the 2025/26 financial year. The landfill has been in operation since the early 2000s and is nearing the end of its lifespan, hence the council is planning its closure. It will mean a loss of a predicted sum of just shy of £1m for Newport city council due to loss of revenes from disposal of commercial waste.

I feel that this presents a perfect opportunity to tokenize this landfill. The land can be leased for 5 years.  
Now before tokenizing, would the hardrive be intact today or would have been galvanized ?  
Howells believes the drive is still functional due to its protective casing and the anti-corrosive cobalt layer coating the glass disk.

Britian isn't Dubai or Japan, so Tokenizing direct 'landfill' might be difficult.

So, instead, we tokenized fund that will hold the lease to the landfill for next 5 years.  
That means:  
\- SPVs.  
\- Legal wrappers.  
\- Some Regulatory layers.  
\- Miscellaneous costs

Setting up Tokenomics

Total tokens - 21 Million  
10% tokens held by James Howells and the Fund.  
Out of the remaining 90% tokens, half i.e. 9.45 million tokens sold over public market at $1.05 thus netting $10 mln to take care of the operational cost.  
We can add vesting schedules if we want to.  
The remaining 50% tokens will be sold if Bitcoin is found  
in the form of Bitcoin treasury allocation.

The 8000 Bitcoin is valued at \~ $950 mln today.

If you consider a rise of even 2x in Bitcoin from here by next year then that's 20000% returns

Using $10 mln raised funds

1. Use of artificial intelligence using a mechanical arm to scan waste to identify the hard drive
2. Using drones, and Boston Dynamics robotic dogs for security, 
3. 3.Recruiting an AI specialist and an environmental team to the project.
4. Experts in landfill excavation, and a data recovery advisor.

Or, develop a community-owned mining facility on the landfill site. The facility would use solar or wind power and generate power revenues.

What if the hardrive wasn't there at the first place?

I think that won't matter considering the possibilities of juicing revenue out of this.

To start with, We can have prediction markets on 'Polymarket' today where a rolling 3-6 monthly market can be run.

I can myself launch 'dCdS' risk markets around excavation (insurance derivatives) on my live product 'Autonomint'.

Today we continue to see more and more of a push for regulation and integration with existing legacy systems even though that directly contradicts the original philosophy of the cryptocurrency community. For example, under the “GENIUS Act”, we have further regulation on stablecoins and the assets that back them. Why? If the dollar fails, if gold fails, then let them. Crypto will survive.

* **Positive Crypto News:** The video highlights what is considered ""the biggest news of all time for crypto,"" mentioning major developments related to Trump's administration, XRP, and Ethereum.
* **Trump Administration's Executive Orders:** The video discusses two executive orders signed by President Trump that are seen as beneficial for the crypto community. The first is an order guaranteeing fair banking for all Americans, which prevents the denial of banking services based on political beliefs or lawful business practices. This is framed as a reversal of ""Operation Chokepoint 2.0"" from the Biden administration. The second order allows over 90 million American workers to access alternative assets, including digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, in their 401k retirement accounts. The host claims this could open up $12 trillion in new potential money for the crypto market.
* **Market Analysis and Predictions:**
    * **Bitcoin:** The video notes a positive pump for Bitcoin following the news and discusses technical indicators, such as the 20-day EMA and the MACD, which suggest a potential bullish crossover and a push toward new all-time highs.
    * **Altcoins:** The host suggests it's ""altcoin's time now,"" anticipating a shift from Bitcoin dominance to altcoins like XRP and ETH.
* **XRP and Ripple's Case:** The video reports that the SEC vs. Ripple case is officially over, which is seen as a victory for Ripple and the crypto community. The host speculates that this resolution could pave the way for BlackRock to file for an iShares XRP ETF.
* **Ethereum Developments:**
    * **Devs' Commitment to Scaling:** The video praises Ethereum developers for committing to a roadmap that will scale the main chain to 10x its current capacity within the next year, aiming for 10,000 transactions per second.
    * **Institutional Interest:** The host notes a recent surge in institutional interest in Ethereum, citing a new treasury company, Fundamental Global Incorporated, that plans to raise $5 billion to buy ETH.
* **Other Crypto Assets:** The video also briefly covers other cryptocurrencies:
    * **Solana (SOL):** Noted for breaking out of a downtrend line, with a MACD bull cross expected soon.
    * **Pudgy Penguins (PANGU):** Mentioned as a meme coin with strong whale inflows and a new expansion into the Asia region.",True,1,DISCUSSION

trump to open the door for crypto in 401(k)s...the realistic analysis,"so there’s talk about trump planning to sign an executive order to open 401(k)s to crypto, real estate, and private equity although as of now, it’s not signed.

why is this important? it means a large new source of capital from regular americans, who mostly had only stocks and bonds before. institutional players and fund managers now have a green light to include crypto options, probably starting with regulated bitcoin and ethereum ETFs. this kind of demand coming from millions of retirement accounts could change liquidity and trading activity significantly.

all the hype around billions in retirement cash flowing into crypto remains only a possibility, not confirmed. regulators haven’t started making rules, and no changes have been made yet.

this means while it’s interesting to consider that $12 trillion+ might eventually move into crypto, it’s important to keep expectations realistic. the market will continue reacting to news and rumors, but nothing is certain.

for traders, this means there could be higher price swings when updates come or if the order is signed and agencies begin taking action. but until then, it’s mainly speculation and waiting.

if this 401(k) crypto integration does happen, millions of americans will suddenly need proper tax reporting for their retirement crypto holdings. platforms like awaken.tax, which specialize in handling complex crypto transactions including DeFi and NFT trades, could see increased demand as retirement account holders navigate the tax implications of crypto investments alongside their traditional portfolios. the current crypto tax landscape is already complex for individual traders—adding retirement account considerations will create new challenges.

so if you’re following developments, stay updated but do not expect immediate effects. real changes depend on the order being signed, regulatory specifics, and how employers implement it.

Note: I repeat trump has not signed the 401(k) crypto order yet. the current market attention is based on potential outcomes, not confirmed events. monitor the situation, but don’t expect retirement funds to start moving into crypto soon. patience is necessary here.",False,56,ANALYSIS

When Markets Start Moving Without You,"The way markets are moving today makes me think. Bitcoin, altcoins, and stocks have been climbing again, and now even China’s A-shares are starting to flip into a proper bull mood. Everything seems to be rising at once. not just the prices, but everything around.  
  
I can remember, not long ago people were still second-guessing everything. The whole mood was stuck in “wait and see.” While a lot of folks probably stayed on the sidelines or cut risk thinking more downside was still coming. And now it’s like the momentum just picked up without giving anyone a clean signal.  
  
This is usually how it goes though. The market rarely makes a big announcement before moving. Things just start shifting, slow at first, then all at once, and by the time people start noticing, most of the early part of the move is already in. And that is what makes it hard. Not just the timing but the patience. The ability to stay exposed even when it feels like nothing is happening, or worse, when it feels like everything might fall apart. Situations like this always bring things like DCA into people’s minds. Not because it’s smart or strategic or any of that, but because it lets them stay in motion without having to solve the whole market puzzle every time. No need to know if it’s the bottom or not. Just bit by bit, and let the averages do their thing over time. It’s not exciting but it keeps you from getting stuck in that cycle of trying to catch the perfect moment and always missing it.  
  
And then when things finally move, like now, you’re already there. You’re not chasing, you are part of it. It’s wild how often the big days come when people are least ready for them. But I guess that is the point. The market moves when it wants, not when people feel confident.",False,6,

The reason that matters is because these type of coins have survived many draw downs remained fluid. You stand the best chance at catching another leg up if/when you go into these projects because degen investors have made it a priority to use ETH/SOL for their onchain activity. No other L1 gets nearly the same activity on chain as those two.

"Why I’m Still Interested in Crypto, Even with All the Noise","Not financial advice, just a personal take

A few years ago, crypto felt like the Wild West. It was full of promise, chaos, scams, and moonshots. While some of that is still true today, there is a shift happening in 2025 that feels different. The level of involvement by governments and major corporations is growing, and that says a lot.

We’re now seeing regular headlines about central banks exploring or launching digital currencies. Tech giants are integrating crypto wallets, and financial institutions like BlackRock, Visa, and Fidelity are quietly building products tied to blockchain and tokenized assets. What was once niche is starting to look like infrastructure.

That doesn’t mean everything is safe or guaranteed. Governments have a long history of twisting innovations to serve their own interests. There’s always the risk of overregulation, surveillance, or centralization of power under the guise of innovation. Public blockchains and decentralization are powerful ideas, but they’re not immune to being co-opted.

Still, the fact that governments and corporations are building anything at all on this tech should not be ignored. It shows that the core concepts behind crypto have staying power. Whether it’s used for payments, identity, or new financial products, blockchain is becoming part of the future.

I’m not telling you to buy anything. I’m not saying to gamble your savings. What I am saying is that it’s worth paying attention. Because this is no longer about just a few coins and online forums. This is about the future of money, data, and power. Knowing what’s coming gives you a better chance of understanding the changes that will affect all of us.

Passive income in crypto?,"
Hey everyone,

I just made a new video on YouTube on passively earning ETH through a process that involves automatically helping with Ethereum blockchain transactions. This isn’t about mining, staking, or trading bots in the traditional sense. It’s something a bit different and much more hands off. No MEV bot nonsense

The idea is pretty simple ..Whenever transactions happen on the Ethereum blockchain, there are opportunities to capture small profits from transaction fees. Normally, those go to miners or validators, but with some tools and the right setup, there are ways for regular users to tap into those same opportunities. My video walks you through how this works, what the risks are.

I came across this method while researching passive crypto income ideas that don’t rely on price speculation or complex trading strategies or even trading bots. A lot of content out there focuses on staking or yield farming, but this is more about participating in the network itself in a semi automated way. It’s especially useful for people who want to accumulate ETH slowly over time without actively trading or managing positions every day.

One of the best things about this method is that it can run in the background. Once it’s set up, it doesn’t require a lot of effort to maintain. Of course, there are some important things to keep in mind, like understanding gas fees, timing, and making sure your setup is safe and efficient. 

The video is meant for beginners as well as people who already understand a bit about how Ethereum works. I try to break things down step by step so you can decide if this is something worth trying for yourself. It’s not a get rich quick thing!

Here’s the link to the video if you want to check it out: [https://youtu.be/ciZ-_-4fqW8?si=JlUC2RzvJEYOWU_-]

I’d love to hear your thoughts if you try this method or have any experience with similar strategies, definitely let me know. I’m always open to improving the content and sharing other ideas in future videos.

XMR is by far the most superior but everyone has given it a bad rap because they actually care about your privacy & anonymity, but well sure it has been used on the Darknet for years… that’s not its only use case scenario but it’s the one you’ll hear & see… 

So that last 25% - look at ADA, TOKE, OMG, RUNE, avoid XRP it’s not even on a blockchain much less anything close to decentralized… DOGE will probably go to a $1 within a year but I can’t attempt to explain how or pretend it’s an investment… it’s decent speculation… 

But yeah, you’re not going to turn that into a million for quite some time, so don’t worry about the get rich quick new coins or anything… just pay attention to what’s actually being used as $ - how often - how much - how convenient - fees? - etc - it’s definitely not Rocket 🚀 Science - as demonstrated by all of the CryptoCowboys in the room… 

Buy low, sell high. You can’t go broke making a profit! People don’t plan to fail, they fail to plan… go get ‘em - you have the most important thing in your side. In fact it’s been called the most powerful force in the universe by Einstein, B Franklin, & many bankers…

Compound Interest 

Your age is your Superpower! Investing 2k every year for the next 10 years now would be the equivalent of investing 5k/yr from age 30-60…within reason…I’m winging the numbers in my head as I type so - yeah someone else can feel free to do the actual math & further emphasize the point… 

BTW, don’t take investment advice from strangers, family, friends or brokers…

"I am given $2,000 to trade crypto, what do I do?","I have a story for you: In 2017, my mom gave me $2k to buy crypto. I bought LTC at $300. 2 months later, I sold it for $100. 1 year after she gave me the money, it all was completely gone. She would always ask me how her crypto is doing, and I would tell her the price as if I put the money into BTC at 20k (0.1 BTC). You can imagine the shame and depression I felt. 

In 2023 when BTC was like 25k i bought 0.1 BTC with my own money, and this BTC is hers. I still hold it and plan to sell around 200k and return the money to her. 

Morals of the story:
1. Don't accept the money.
2. If you do accept it, be completely clear on everything you do. Tell them your brand new to crypto and there's a very high chance you lose all the money. Every trade you make you need to tell them. Tell them their exact balance and what coin they hold. 
3. Keep it simple and buy one asset that is unlikely to go to 0. BTC, ETH, or SOL are the only ones I can confidently say wont go to 0 anytime soon.
4. Give the money back. If you can get it to 5k, just sell and give them the money. 2.5x is good for this stage of the market. 
5. If you do grow this 2k they'll tell people about it and others might want to invest, or the same guy might want to invest more. At peak bull market there's a lot of intrest.

Alt season 18 months post-bitcoin halving?,"I've posted this before in a comment, but what does everyone think of the *""Alt season occurs 18 months after Bitcoin halving""* that happened the last two cycles in a row? That would mean altcoins should theoretically spike in October 2025 right? Two months from now? October 2025 would be 18 months after April 2024, thus repeating the same cycle of the previous two.

Also, a few people were saying *""the trend won't apply anymore, no more alt seasons""* but did people say that in both 2016 and 2020 too? Or is this a new sentiment?

1. First Cycle:

→ Bitcoin halving: November 28, 2012

→ Altseason peak: December 2013

→ Time between: \~13 months

2. Second Cycle:

→ Bitcoin halving: July 9, 2016

→ Altseason peak: January 2018

→ Time between: \~18 months

3. Third Cycle:

→ Bitcoin halving: May 11, 2020

→ Altseason peak: November 2021

→ Time between: \~18 months

*""This pattern supports the idea that altcoins usually peak 13–18 months after a Bitcoin halving, often near the tail end of the overall bull market.""*

*""If this trend continues, then following the April 19, 2024 halving, the next altseason peak could likely occur October 2025.""*

I am frustrated with the constant search for coins to invest in 2025,"Back in the day — think 2017 or even early 2021 — the crypto market felt *narrower*, *cleaner*, *simpler*. The choices were limited. You had maybe 100–200 coins worth seriously analyzing. Everyone knew the top players, and real hidden gems could be spotted with some patience, a few Discords, and a bit of technical reading.

Today? You’re swimming in a sea of over 10,000 tokens, most of which are noise. Smart contracts can be deployed in minutes. Meme culture has blurred the line between parody and project. And AI-generated whitepapers are now a thing.

We're not just battling market volatility anymore — we're battling *signal overload*.

# Why It's Getting So Much Harder (by my opinion and experience only)

* Explosion of tokens: Every chain now has hundreds (or thousands) of tokens. Many are copy-pastes. Some are rugs with decent branding. A few are legitimate but buried under noise.
* Surface-level metrics are no longer enough: TVL? Faked. Followers? Bottable. Website? GPT-4 can spin up a fake ""ecosystem"" in a day.
* Narrative fatigue: Each cycle spawns dozens of trendy narratives (AI, RWA, DePIN, ZK, Modular...). Half of them are vaporware, but the hype still pumps them.
* Retail vs Bots vs VCs: You're not just competing with fellow humans. You're competing with trading bots, VC insider info, and Telegram groups front-running news before you even finish reading the headline.

# What This Means for Investors

If you're serious about finding alpha, it's no longer enough to just look at the top gainers or read daily Twitter (sorry X) threads.

You need:

* A framework for evaluating early-stage tokens (not just vibes).
* A way to track on-chain movement and whale behavior.
* A feel for tokenomics, vesting cliffs, and where the team might exit.
* Most importantly — the patience to say *no* 99 times out of 100.

# The Diamonds Are Still There — Just Buried Deeper

Yes, it's harder. Yes, it's more competitive. But in a strange way, that's bullish:  
True edge now comes from research, not hype.

The market is shifting. The next cycle’s winners are being built now — and they’re likely still under the radar.
