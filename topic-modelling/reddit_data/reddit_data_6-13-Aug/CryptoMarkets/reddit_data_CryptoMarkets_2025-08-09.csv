"XRP sentiment shift, too much noise or quiet breakout in the making?","Something‚Äôs definitely cooking with XRP lately, and it‚Äôs not just price action.  
Between steady on-chain activity, a rise in institutional mentions, and a noticeable uptick in social volume (especially from accounts that usually ignore XRP), I feel like we‚Äôre heading into one of those classic XRP pre-breakout phases.

I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre about to 10x next week, but the relative silence compared to the rest of the market feels‚Ä¶ intentional. Sort of like how SOL was being accumulated low-key before it ran. Same energy here.

I‚Äôve held XRP through all the noise, FUD, and lawsuits - and honestly I‚Äôve never seen the market this evenly split between indifference and quiet conviction. I‚Äôve personally decided to reposition part of my XRP holdings into yield, just to make use of the lull.

For those interested, I recently moved some XRP to Nexo, where they‚Äôre running a 5% XRP-back promo, and optionally offering up to 12% APR if you stake. I‚Äôm not going heavy on staking, but the bonus was a no-brainer since I was rotating wallets anyway. 

What‚Äôs tricky is that XRP tends to move when people least expect it. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we‚Äôre in a classic accumulation zone before something bigger plays out, especially if macro factors or another Ripple announcement kicks in.",False,2,Discussion

Real trading with crypto vs Paper Trading,"Real trading involves buying and selling financial assets using actual money, exposing you to real profits, losses, and market risks. Paper trading is a simulation using virtual money that allows practicing trading strategies risk-free without any real capital at stake.

Key differences include:

Capital: Real trading uses real funds, risking actual loss or gain; paper trading uses virtual funds, so no real financial impact occurs.

Emotional Impact: Real trading triggers emotions like fear and greed, affecting decisions; paper trading is emotionally neutral without real stakes.

Execution: Paper trading assumes ideal order fills without slippage or latency, while real trading involves delays and imperfect fills due to market factors.

Market Influence: Real trades affect market prices and liquidity; paper trades do not impact actual markets.

Risk and Stress: Real trading carries financial risk and stress from potential losses; paper trading is stress-free allowing experimentation",False,4,

Dr. Richard Werner laid bare the machinery of inflation, war, and inequality. He may not have said the word ""Bitcoin,"" but he built its most compelling case.  
  
Every so often, a conversation slices through the static of our daily news cycle and strikes at the very foundation of our reality. It doesn't just present new facts; it provides a new lens through which to see the world, revealing that the chaos we experience isn't random but a product of a hidden design. Tucker Carlson's recent interview with Dr. Richard Werner was one such moment.  
  
Werner, a German economist with a quiet demeanor that belies the explosive nature of his work, has been labeled by some as ‚Äúthe most dangerous economist in the world.‚Äù Why? His core thesis doesn't just challenge a specific policy or critique a political party. It dynamites the entire bedrock of modern banking and economics, exposing the system for what it is: a mechanism of control, engineered for specific outcomes.  
  
Throughout the conversation, Werner methodically dismantled the comforting lies we are told about money. The result was a chillingly clear picture of how inflation, perpetual war, and crushing inequality are not unfortunate byproducts of a complex system, but rather the intended output of its engine. And in doing so, whether he intended to or not, he erected the single greatest billboard for Bitcoin imaginable. He described the disease in such perfect detail that the cure became self-evident.

* **Positive Crypto News:** The video highlights what is considered ""the biggest news of all time for crypto,"" mentioning major developments related to Trump's administration, XRP, and Ethereum.
* **Trump Administration's Executive Orders:** The video discusses two executive orders signed by President Trump that are seen as beneficial for the crypto community. The first is an order guaranteeing fair banking for all Americans, which prevents the denial of banking services based on political beliefs or lawful business practices. This is framed as a reversal of ""Operation Chokepoint 2.0"" from the Biden administration. The second order allows over 90 million American workers to access alternative assets, including digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, in their 401k retirement accounts. The host claims this could open up $12 trillion in new potential money for the crypto market.
* **Market Analysis and Predictions:**
¬† ¬† * **Bitcoin:** The video notes a positive pump for Bitcoin following the news and discusses technical indicators, such as the 20-day EMA and the MACD, which suggest a potential bullish crossover and a push toward new all-time highs.
¬† ¬† * **Altcoins:** The host suggests it's ""altcoin's time now,"" anticipating a shift from Bitcoin dominance to altcoins like XRP and ETH.
* **XRP and Ripple's Case:** The video reports that the SEC vs. Ripple case is officially over, which is seen as a victory for Ripple and the crypto community. The host speculates that this resolution could pave the way for BlackRock to file for an iShares XRP ETF.
* **Ethereum Developments:**
¬† ¬† * **Devs' Commitment to Scaling:** The video praises Ethereum developers for committing to a roadmap that will scale the main chain to 10x its current capacity within the next year, aiming for 10,000 transactions per second.
¬† ¬† * **Institutional Interest:** The host notes a recent surge in institutional interest in Ethereum, citing a new treasury company, Fundamental Global Incorporated, that plans to raise $5 billion to buy ETH.
* **Other Crypto Assets:** The video also briefly covers other cryptocurrencies:
¬† ¬† * **Solana (SOL):** Noted for breaking out of a downtrend line, with a MACD bull cross expected soon.
¬† ¬† * **Pudgy Penguins (PANGU):** Mentioned as a meme coin with strong whale inflows and a new expansion into the Asia region.",True,-14,Discussion
BTC vs Spot ETF,"First, I promise this is not a promotion for FBTC!
So I've been researching BTC and FBTC and I am trying to find the upside FOR ME, in owning BTC outright.  The returns appear to mirror each other.  Keep in mind I myself don't care about holding BTC unless there is a big upside. I just want to add and diversify to my retirement portfolio.
 I'm thinking it would be nice to not have to worry about wallets and keys and transfers.  I have my entire stock and ETF portfolio at Fidelity and am thinking it just seems easier to buy the etf just like everything else I invest it.  Any thoughts on this minus expense ratio?

This idea is gaining a lot of traction in India recently, and is generating attention from the Gov't.

I doubt it will be that large ($577 Billion) - but the top Crypto voices in India are taking their idea mainstream.

Does Tokenizing the Newport landfill makes sense?,"James Howells, an IT worker from South Wales, had used his laptop to 'mine' \~ 8000 units of digital Bitcoin currency in 2009. He was the one of only 5 miners in 2009. In 2010, the Dell XPS N1710 broke after he spilt lemonade on it, so he dismantled the computer¬† for parts, kept the drive in a desk drawer and later binned it.

That hardrive is now sitting at Newport landfill somewhere buried under 25,000 cubic meters of waste and earth"", weighing approximately 110,000‚Äì200,000 tonnes. To give you the scale, it could be anywhere beneath an area of rubbish the size of a football pitch.

Now, as per the latest news, the landfill site is set to permanently close in the 2025/26 financial year. The landfill has been in operation since the early 2000s and is nearing the end of its lifespan, hence the council is planning its closure. It will mean a loss of a predicted sum of just shy of ¬£1m for Newport city council due to loss of revenes from disposal of commercial waste.

I feel that this presents a perfect opportunity to tokenize this landfill. The land can be leased for 5 years.  
Now before tokenizing, would the hardrive be intact today or would have been galvanized ?  
Howells believes the drive is still functional due to its protective casing and the anti-corrosive cobalt layer coating the glass disk.

Britian isn't Dubai or Japan, so Tokenizing direct 'landfill' might be difficult.

So, instead, we tokenized fund that will hold the lease to the landfill for next 5 years.  
That means:  
\- SPVs.  
\- Legal wrappers.  
\- Some Regulatory layers.  
\- Miscellaneous costs

Setting up Tokenomics

Total tokens - 21 Million  
10% tokens held by James Howells and the Fund.  
Out of the remaining 90% tokens, half i.e. 9.45 million tokens sold over public market at $1.05 thus netting $10 mln to take care of the operational cost.  
We can add vesting schedules if we want to.  
The remaining 50% tokens will be sold if Bitcoin is found  
in the form of Bitcoin treasury allocation.

The 8000 Bitcoin is valued at \~ $950 mln today.

If you consider a rise of even 2x in Bitcoin from here by next year then that's 20000% returns

Using $10 mln raised funds

1. Use of artificial intelligence using a mechanical arm to scan waste to identify the hard drive
2. Using drones, and Boston Dynamics robotic dogs for security, 
3. 3.Recruiting an AI specialist and an environmental team to the project.
4. Experts in landfill excavation, and a data recovery advisor.

Or, develop a community-owned mining facility on the landfill site. The facility would use solar or wind power and generate power revenues.

What if the hardrive wasn't there at the first place?

I think that won't matter considering the possibilities of juicing revenue out of this.

To start with, We can have prediction markets on 'Polymarket' today where a rolling 3-6 monthly market can be run.

I can myself launch 'dCdS' risk markets around excavation (insurance derivatives) on my live product 'Autonomint'.

There could be 'Media + Story Monetization' as This is a Netflix special waiting to happen

* **Trump Administration's Executive Orders:** The video discusses two executive orders signed by President Trump that are seen as beneficial for the crypto community. The first is an order guaranteeing fair banking for all Americans, which prevents the denial of banking services based on political beliefs or lawful business practices.

* **XRP and Ripple's Case:** The video reports that the SEC vs. Ripple case is officially over, which is seen as a victory for Ripple and the crypto community. The host speculates that this resolution could pave the way for BlackRock to file for an iShares XRP ETF.

trump to open the door for crypto in 401(k)s...the realistic analysis,"so there‚Äôs talk about trump planning to sign an executive order to open 401(k)s to crypto, real estate, and private equity although as of now, it‚Äôs not signed.

why is this important? it means a large new source of capital from regular americans, who mostly had only stocks and bonds before. institutional players and fund managers now have a green light to include crypto options, probably starting with regulated bitcoin and ethereum ETFs. this kind of demand coming from millions of retirement accounts could change liquidity and trading activity significantly.

all the hype around billions in retirement cash flowing into crypto remains only a possibility, not confirmed. regulators haven‚Äôt started making rules, and no changes have been made yet.

this means while it‚Äôs interesting to consider that $12 trillion+ might eventually move into crypto, it‚Äôs important to keep expectations realistic. the market will continue reacting to news and rumors, but nothing is certain.

for traders, this means there could be higher price swings when updates come or if the order is signed and agencies begin taking action. but until then, it‚Äôs mainly speculation and waiting.

if this 401(k) crypto integration does happen, millions of americans will suddenly need proper tax reporting for their retirement crypto holdings. platforms like awaken.tax, which specialize in handling complex crypto transactions including DeFi and NFT trades, could see increased demand as retirement account holders navigate the tax implications of crypto investments alongside their traditional portfolios. the current crypto tax landscape is already complex for individual traders‚Äîadding retirement account considerations will create new challenges.

so if you‚Äôre following developments, stay updated but do not expect immediate effects. real changes depend on the order being signed, regulatory specifics, and how employers implement it.

Note: I repeat trump has not signed the 401(k) crypto order yet. the current market attention is based on potential outcomes, not confirmed events. monitor the situation, but don‚Äôt expect retirement funds to start moving into crypto soon. patience is necessary here.",False,55,ANALYSIS

trump to open the door for crypto in 401(k)s...the realistic analysis,"The infrastructure isn't ready for this. Most people can barely figure out their current 401(k) dashboard. Adding crypto options without proper education could be a disaster.

I'm curious if this pushes the space toward more utility-focused projects or just pumps BTC/ETH. Institutional money tends to be more risk-averse, so probably the latter initially.

Even if Trump signs it tomorrow, the actual implementation is probably years away. Too many moving parts between regulators, employers, and platforms. Wild to think we might be looking at the beginning of crypto becoming as boring and mainstream as index funds though.",True,0,ANALYSIS

When Markets Start Moving Without You,"The way markets are moving today makes me think. Bitcoin, altcoins, and stocks have been climbing again, and now even China‚Äôs A-shares are starting to flip into a proper bull mood. Everything seems to be rising at once. not just the prices, but everything around.  
  
I can remember, not long ago people were still second-guessing everything. The whole mood was stuck in ‚Äúwait and see.‚Äù While a lot of folks probably stayed on the sidelines or cut risk thinking more downside was still coming. And now it‚Äôs like the momentum just picked up without giving anyone a clean signal.  
  
This is usually how it goes though. The market rarely makes a big announcement before moving. Things just start shifting, slow at first, then all at once, and by the time people start noticing, most of the early part of the move is already in. And that is what makes it hard. Not just the timing but the patience. The ability to stay exposed even when it feels like nothing is happening, or worse, when it feels like everything might fall apart. Situations like this always bring things like DCA into people‚Äôs minds. Not because it‚Äôs smart or strategic or any of that, but because it lets them stay in motion without having to solve the whole market puzzle every time. No need to know if it‚Äôs the bottom or not. Just bit by bit, and let the averages do their thing over time. It‚Äôs not exciting but it keeps you from getting stuck in that cycle of trying to catch the perfect moment and always missing it.  
  
And then when things finally move, like now, you‚Äôre already there. You‚Äôre not chasing, you are part of it. It‚Äôs wild how often the big days come when people are least ready for them. But I guess that is the point. The market moves when it wants, not when people feel confident.",False,6,

"Why I‚Äôm Still Interested in Crypto, Even with All the Noise","Not financial advice, just a personal take

A few years ago, crypto felt like the Wild West. It was full of promise, chaos, scams, and moonshots. While some of that is still true today, there is a shift happening in 2025 that feels different. The level of involvement by governments and major corporations is growing, and that says a lot.

We‚Äôre now seeing regular headlines about central banks exploring or launching digital currencies. Tech giants are integrating crypto wallets, and financial institutions like BlackRock, Visa, and Fidelity are quietly building products tied to blockchain and tokenized assets. What was once niche is starting to look like infrastructure.

That doesn‚Äôt mean everything is safe or guaranteed. Governments have a long history of twisting innovations to serve their own interests. There‚Äôs always the risk of overregulation, surveillance, or centralization of power under the guise of innovation. Public blockchains and decentralization are powerful ideas, but they‚Äôre not immune to being co-opted.

Still, the fact that governments and corporations are building anything at all on this tech should not be ignored. It shows that the core concepts behind crypto have staying power. Whether it‚Äôs used for payments, identity, or new financial products, blockchain is becoming part of the future.

I‚Äôm not telling you to buy anything. I‚Äôm not saying to gamble your savings. What I am saying is that it‚Äôs worth paying attention. Because this is no longer about just a few coins and online forums. This is about the future of money, data, and power. Knowing what‚Äôs coming gives you a better chance of understanding the changes that will affect all of us.

Passive income in crypto?,"
Hey everyone,

I just made a new video on YouTube on passively earning ETH through a process that involves automatically helping with Ethereum blockchain transactions. This isn‚Äôt about mining, staking, or trading bots in the traditional sense. It‚Äôs something a bit different and much more hands off. No MEV bot nonsense

The idea is pretty simple ..Whenever transactions happen on the Ethereum blockchain, there are opportunities to capture small profits from transaction fees. Normally, those go to miners or validators, but with some tools and the right setup, there are ways for regular users to tap into those same opportunities. My video walks you through how this works, what the risks are.

I came across this method while researching passive crypto income ideas that don‚Äôt rely on price speculation or complex trading strategies or even trading bots. A lot of content out there focuses on staking or yield farming, but this is more about participating in the network itself in a semi automated way. It‚Äôs especially useful for people who want to accumulate ETH slowly over time without actively trading or managing positions every day.

One of the best things about this method is that it can run in the background. Once it‚Äôs set up, it doesn‚Äôt require a lot of effort to maintain. Of course, there are some important things to keep in mind, like understanding gas fees, timing, and making sure your setup is safe and efficient. 

The video is meant for beginners as well as people who already understand a bit about how Ethereum works. I try to break things down step by step so you can decide if this is something worth trying for yourself. It‚Äôs not a get rich quick thing!

Here‚Äôs the link to the video if you want to check it out: [https://youtu.be/ciZ-_-4fqW8?si=JlUC2RzvJEYOWU_-]

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts if you try this method or have any experience with similar strategies, definitely let me know. I‚Äôm always open to improving the content and sharing other ideas in future videos.

SOL is a meme chain and not suitable for anything with serious financial implications.

The chain often goes down.
It is a centralized service.
When it goes down, it's literally a Discord chat popularity contest to decide what block to roll the chain back to.

Stay away from SOL.
It is for suckers, hoping other suckers jump in to provide exit liquidity. 



Ethereum, on the other hand, is an exceptional investment, especially if you stake it.

I dont know how you got this ""opportunity"" but it's not what you think it is. Someone had ""paid"" you $2000 to do something you do not know how to do and you really want to be successful. It sounds like you are asking how to make more money by 'trading crypto' not holding crypto. Day trading is one of the most brutal, unforgiving, and complex industry out there. You do not want to get involved with it from a place of having zero knowledge. 

If you are serious, and you want to turn this $2000 into $2000+ your best bet is a combination of staking and holding. Trading will absolutely get you rekt. 

A very important step here will be framing your expectations. If you are hoping to turn this $2000 into more than $3000 you need to understand that, if that was easy, more people will be doing it. If you understand you can use crypto as an inflation hedge and hope to earn more than the 3-5% growth traditional investments would yield, you will have a much better time with the results you can realistically expect.

Alt season 18 months post-bitcoin halving?,"I've posted this before in a comment, but what does everyone think of the *""Alt season occurs 18 months after Bitcoin halving""* that happened the last two cycles in a row? That would mean altcoins should theoretically spike in October 2025 right? Two months from now? October 2025 would be 18 months after April 2024, thus repeating the same cycle of the previous two.

Also, a few people were saying *""the trend won't apply anymore, no more alt seasons""* but did people say that in both 2016 and 2020 too? Or is this a new sentiment?

‚Üí Bitcoin halving: November 28, 2012

2. Second Cycle:

‚Üí Altseason peak: January 2018

‚Üí Time between: \~18 months

3. Third Cycle:

‚Üí Bitcoin halving: May 11, 2020

‚Üí Altseason peak: November 2021

‚Üí Time between: \~18 months

I am frustrated with the constant search for coins to invest in 2025,"Back in the day ‚Äî think 2017 or even early 2021 ‚Äî the crypto market felt *narrower*, *cleaner*, *simpler*. The choices were limited. You had maybe 100‚Äì200 coins worth seriously analyzing. Everyone knew the top players, and real hidden gems could be spotted with some patience, a few Discords, and a bit of technical reading.

Today? You‚Äôre swimming in a sea of over 10,000 tokens, most of which are noise. Smart contracts can be deployed in minutes. Meme culture has blurred the line between parody and project. And AI-generated whitepapers are now a thing.

We're not just battling market volatility anymore ‚Äî we're battling *signal overload*.

# Why It's Getting So Much Harder (by my opinion and experience only)

* Explosion of tokens: Every chain now has hundreds (or thousands) of tokens. Many are copy-pastes. Some are rugs with decent branding. A few are legitimate but buried under noise.
* Surface-level metrics are no longer enough: TVL? Faked. Followers? Bottable. Website? GPT-4 can spin up a fake ""ecosystem"" in a day.
* Narrative fatigue: Each cycle spawns dozens of trendy narratives (AI, RWA, DePIN, ZK, Modular...). Half of them are vaporware, but the hype still pumps them.
* Retail vs Bots vs VCs: You're not just competing with fellow humans. You're competing with trading bots, VC insider info, and Telegram groups front-running news before you even finish reading the headline.

# What This Means for Investors

If you're serious about finding alpha, it's no longer enough to just look at the top gainers or read daily Twitter (sorry X) threads.

You need:

* A framework for evaluating early-stage tokens (not just vibes).
* A way to track on-chain movement and whale behavior.
* A feel for tokenomics, vesting cliffs, and where the team might exit.
* Most importantly ‚Äî the patience to say *no* 99 times out of 100.

# The Diamonds Are Still There ‚Äî Just Buried Deeper

Yes, it's harder. Yes, it's more competitive. But in a strange way, that's bullish:  
True edge now comes from research, not hype.

The market is shifting. The next cycle‚Äôs winners are being built now ‚Äî and they‚Äôre likely still under the radar.

The company had set up investment plan for its users, but without any consent, dollars were withdrawn from our accounts. This has led to significant financial losses for many of us. About everyone's account is zerod out.

‚ö†Ô∏è How to Protect Yourself

Don't invest in this company whoever shares the plan with you.
Always be cautious with platforms that have access to your personal or financial accounts.

If you‚Äôre involved with Mobicryp, immediately check your transactions and account activity.

Right now, many people see altcoins as a quick flip with no long-term viability. Essentially, if a coin gets branded as a short-term hot potato game, you will have trouble finding new marginal buyers to offset the sellers who want to rush out to not be the last bag holder in each rally.

All these altcoin ""utility"" coins are traded on borrowed conviction/narratives, aka I buy utility coin, not because I find the coin to give the utility I want, but to sell to the next guy who thinks someone else will find utility valuable to the next guy who thinks someone else will find utility valuable.... aka these coins wholistically lack intrinsic value to nearly every buyer. In terms of extrinsic value, altcoins are traded like stocks of unprofitable/limited-growth companies. So you end up with assets lacking intrinsic value and good objective fundamentals, justifying bids on an extrinsic basis.

In consequence, the altcoin market becomes a game of who can get in early to rug late buyers. Hence, the market cap can't grow because there is simply a lack of belief (on both intrinsic/extrinsic basis) that they should be valued higher.",True,1,

Initially there was just Ethereum and then there were a handful of coins and now there are thousands being created every day.

Just read the posts and comments on here and you will see that everyone thinks THEIR alt coin is the one that will run. These coins can only go up based on money inflows. And there are exponentially more choices that means the same money flow is being spread exponentially thin across all of them.

These Are the Only Crypto Levels That Matter Right Now (How to Avoid August‚Äôs Trap Setups This Week),"If you read the last breakdown on why August trading gets weird, you already know the drill:

* Low liquidity
* No macro signals
* Chop with no follow-through
* Retail gets baited early, loses edge

Sunday and Monday flashed some price bumps-which triggered FOMO for frothed up retail traders. But, as we discussed -those were bad moves to make.

So how do you actually beat the August traps this-and probably next week?

# Playbook:

No long trades this week or next unless these macro-confirmation levels start to trigger:

* BTC/USDT must break above $120K to prove strength
* USDT.D needs to fall below 4.34%-stablecoin exit = risk-on
* TOTAL3 must clear $1.115T to validate altcoin participation
* BTC/USDT below $116K = invalidation zone (and it's there now)
* ETH/BTC above 0.0329 signals alt rotation, especially ETH-led

Traders keep reacting to surface level moves: green candles, volume spikes, sudden pumps. But in August? That‚Äôs the trap. No volume + no macro =no trend.

Only price levels tied to dominance flows, total market cap shifts, and BTC compression breakouts offer real edge.

Want to survive August and more than likely come out booking a positive month? Don‚Äôt guess. Let confirmation come to you. These five levels are your filter. No triggers=no long trades.

What makes a crypto platform the right choice?,"This is just my personal opinion , but I think when the discussion of safety practices in crypto comes up, choosing the right platform should also be mentioned, especially for people who are just starting out. 

It's a lot easier now because you we have a couple of reputable platforms that users can just choose from, but I think it's also important to know what you intend to do and which of these platforms works for that. 

  
I would always go back to the p2p issue I had when Binance got restricted in my region and how my search for replacement led me to Bitget, which nw looking back worked out for me, they recently got named exchange of the year by Finance Feeds, so it's good to see that I'm not the only one that thinks I made the right decision. 

But replace my example with any other utility or feature, what you want to be looking for a platform that can offer tighter spreads, deeper liquidity, better uptime during volatility, and features like bot support or early access to promising tokens. 

  
All of these details can look very small, but they have a huge impact on your long-term gains, and to be fair if you pick reputable platforms that offers these, your chances of getting scammed is lower. ",False,1,EXCHANGE

A Sad Crypto Story,"Back in 2011, a programmer named Stefan Thomas made a short animated video called ‚ÄúWhat is Bitcoin?‚Äù just a simple explainer to help people understand this strange new digital currency. For his work, he was paid 7,002 bitcoins. At the time, that wasn't a big deal. Bitcoin was worth just a few dollars, and no one really knew what it would become.

Stefan, who believed in the technology, stored the coins on a secure USB drive called an IronKey. It was built for maximum security so secure, in fact, that if you forget the password, you only get ten chances to guess it before it locks forever. Stefan wrote the password down on a slip of paper, then misplaced it.

Fast forward a decade, and Bitcoin has exploded in value. Those 7,002 coins are now worth over $800 million. But Stefan can‚Äôt get to them. He‚Äôs used eight out of his ten tries, and every wrong guess brings him closer to losing it all permanently.

He‚Äôs talked to security experts, cryptographers, even companies that specialize in data recovery. They all told him the same thing: there‚Äôs no way in. The encryption on the IronKey is practically impossible to crack. No reset button. No backup. No customer support to call.

Stefan has spoken publicly about how he‚Äôs tried to make peace with the situation. He doesn‚Äôt dwell on it anymore, because what else can he do? It‚Äôs not about being careless or greedy. It‚Äôs just a painful reminder of how easy it is to lose something incredibly valuable,not because you lost the thing itself, but because you forgot the key to it.

His story has become legendary in the crypto world,a quiet warning about the risks of self-custody in a digital age. When your wealth is protected by a password, forgetting it can cost you everything.

In 2023, security researchers at Unciphered claimed they found a way to bypass the IronKey's 10-attempt limit using advanced hardware techniques. They offered to help, but Thomas declined, saying he had already made deals with other recovery teams. The Bitcoin remains locked.

His holdings are currently valued at over $820 million.",False,149,NEWS

A Sad Crypto Story,"It's been nearly 2 years since Thomas declined Unciphered's offer. At the time, his reason for declining to work with Unciphered seemed odd, but plausible. As far as I know, even today no other firms claim to have defeated IronKey's controls like Unciphered has. And I don't think Thomas has ever named the two firms he said he's had handshake deals with to attempt to do so. They've had 3 years to try. Time for him to give Unciphered a shot since they'd successfully gained access to encrypted IronKey devices by 2023?

If Thomas is to be believed he also accidentally deleted two backup copies of the crypto wallet and lost the paper with the password for the IronKey device. Ouch.

From the October 2023 Wired article:

>In an email to WIRED, Thomas confirmed that he had turned down Unciphered's offer to unlock his encrypted fortune. ‚ÄúI have already been working with a different set of experts on the recovery so I'm no longer free to negotiate with someone new,‚Äù Thomas wrote. ‚ÄúIt's possible that the current team could decide to subcontract Unciphered if they feel that's the best option. We'll have to wait and see.‚Äù Thomas declined to be interviewed or to comment further.[They Cracked the Code to a Locked USB Drive Worth $235 Million in Bitcoin. Then It Got Weird](https://www.wired.com/story/unciphered-ironkey-password-cracking-bitcoin/)

>In past interviews, Thomas has said that his 7,002 bitcoins were left over from a payment he received for making a video titled ‚ÄúWhat is Bitcoin?‚Äù that published on YouTube in early 2011, when a bitcoin was worth less than a dollar. Later that year, he told¬†WIRED¬†that he'd inadvertently erased two backup copies of the wallet that held those thousands of coins, and then lost the piece of paper with the password to decrypt the third copy, stored on the IronKey.
