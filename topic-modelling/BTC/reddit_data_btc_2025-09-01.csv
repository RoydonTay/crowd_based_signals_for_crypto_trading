Fiat go down yes. 

But fiat only bad for normies….. 

When you have billions you can leverage debt against it at like 0.01% interest…. 

Then you can take that money and go buy assets that will pay a yield higher than the inflation rate of fiat and your interest payments, also your interest payments become “less” because you’re paying it out overtime as fiat deflates. 

So in reality fiat is the perfect instrument for the extremely wealthy and truthfully that’s where my skepticism lies in Bitcoin. 

It only makes sense for regular people. 

But the rich control about 38% of the world’s wealth. 

Some of it might touch bitcoin but if you’re a billionaire ask yourself. 

What’s so good about Bitcoin other than a slight hedge or short term speculation ? 

If I’m wrong about anything as a billionaire, I’m systemic, I can just get bailed out by big institutions or other wealthy individuals, and in some cases the government itself (JP Morgan 2008 financial crisis) 


It’ll be interesting to see what happens to say the least but I no longer objectively believe 100% of the world’s wealth will go to Bitcoin. Maybe 10-20% max imo. 

I still think it can go up forever though because that 10-20% is relative to the amount of GDP or global wealth (depending on which one you want to account for) 

As global wealth and GDP grows I could still see Bitcoin maintaining that 10-20% but truthfully, I don’t think it gets passed that.

The unraveling of the great con,"As most in the know are aware of, BTC is functionally useless. To be precise, it doesn‘t scale. And it‘s L2 is a joke. Why it doesn‘t scale is besides at this point, if it would‘ve ever done so, that time has long past since 2017, and it never done it since, so the point is moot. It‘s not gonna scale.

This is a problem, because a useless crippled shitcoin isn‘t exactly gonna work out well to be bought up by everyone. They‘re gonna figure it out eventually. And that‘s when the fun times starts. Because it means most of the crypto markets valuation will, some day, go for a walk in the park and never come back. That‘s gonna leave a lot of people and companies pretty upset. They might say a choice word or two. And crypto, all of it, will be a laughing stock for an indeterminate amount of time.

We can‘t avoid this problem. We tried. But now it‘s too late. I tell you this, not as a prediction, but as a precaution. You might squabble about the likelihood of such events, and it may never occur, granted. Though I believe it‘s very likely to occur on account of the facts. It may happen at any point in time, or never, and be mostly over before anyone was able to move their funds (on account of the trading bots). You will not be able to trade your way out of this one, or even limit your losses. Exchanges will fold like going out of business is a new hot trend, by the time you want to trade, the exchange is bust or closed and whatever funds where in it is now bankruptcy frozen. And as for institutional investors, they‘re even more screwed, because they hold illiquid positions, i.e. positions too large to quickly move them on the markets without cratering them.

"2022-2025, BCH exchange wallets tell the fascinating story of panic sellers selling low, smart money absorbing liquidations, and long term investors buying daily to DCA/invest outpacing limited mining rewards and liquid supply.","When a person or entity sells an asset at a very low price, often due to panic, financial distress, or a forced liquidation, this is known as a distressed sale. The assets are usually purchased by buyers who have a longer-term perspective and the financial capacity to take advantage of the low price. These buyers may include institutions, liquidity providers, or savvy retail investors.



**2022 Bear market:**



In the 2022 bear market, BCH experienced a significant downturn, with prices plummeting from over $1,000 to as low as $100. This steep decline was fueled by a number of factors, including:

* **Forced liquidations** of highly-leveraged investors.
* The **exit scam** by crypto exchange CoinFLEX, which resulted in the forced liquidation of hundreds of thousands of BCH.
* **Panic selling** by investors who sold their holdings at any price to avoid further losses.

This massive sell-off created a temporary oversupply of BCH on the market. However, institutions, liquidity providers, and experienced retail buyers quickly stepped in to buy up every available coin in the $100–$200 range. These buyers were able to acquire BCH at a deeply discounted price, recognizing that the long-term fundamentals of the asset remained strong despite the temporary panic.

The price of BCH simply couldn't stay that low forever. The supply of BCH is static, with new coins only entering circulation through mining rewards, which were already below demand. The massive sell-off was a one-time event that temporarily flooded the market with coins. Once these distressed assets were bought up by new holders, they were taken off the market, and the supply of BCH for sale became scarce again. This created a floor price for the asset, and the price gradually started to increase over time.

**Panic Selling vs. Strategic Buying**

Panic sellers often act on emotion, selling low and buying high. When prices are low, they declare the asset ""dead"" and sell everything. But when prices rise, they become euphoric and buy back in. In contrast, strategic buyers with long-term vision, like the market makers and liquidity providers who stepped in, purchased BCH when it was being liquidated for cents on the dollar, effectively creating a floor price for the asset.

**The Power of Limited Supply**

Assets with a limited supply, like BCH, can't keep up with consistent demand. As new buyers enter the market, the available supply for sale decreases. This dynamic can be temporarily disrupted by one-off events, such as large-scale liquidations, but once the distressed supply is absorbed by new holders, demand can quickly outpace supply, leading to price appreciation.",False,7,📰 Report
Does BTC truly belong to the people now?,"What is the most reliable analysis showing how fairly Bitcoin is distributed among its holders?

The usual measure for wealth concentration is the Gini coefficient, which indicates how unequally wealth is spread. For traditional wealth, the Gini  of 0.8  shows that 20% percentage of people hold 80% of total wealth. In Bitcoin, however, reported Gini coefficients vary widely depending on the calculation method between 0.65 to 0.98, making it unclear how fair the distribution really is.

Which analysis can be considered the most realistic?

From my perspective, the fact that “shrimps” (addresses holding less than 1 BTC) collectively own only around 7% of the supply suggests that Bitcoin was effectively captured by a small group of early whales: https://bitinfocharts.com/de/bitcoin-distribution-history.html

While large institutions own only about 8% of the total BTC supply, and only 8% are on exchanges:
 https://www.coinglass.com/Balance
the other 70-80% are in hands of some whales: https://bitcointreasuries.net

If those whales bought millions of BTC for just a few cents, then true generational wealth through Bitcoin may not be possible for newcomers. At best, it might outperform the S&P 500 over time—but mainly as whales gradually liquidate their enormous early holdings.

Shrimp share is rising  while they hold ~7%, that number has been climbing every cycle, meaning retail is slowly chipping away.


Whales vs. exchanges  many “whale” wallets are really exchanges holding for millions of users, so the picture isn’t as lopsided as bitinfocharts suggests.


Satoshi & early miners  the dormant 1M+ coins are a distortion, but since they’re immobile, they don’t affect active distribution.




Most realistic view: Bitcoin is still concentrated, but moving toward broader ownership. It’s not perfectly “for the people,” but it’s less rigged than the raw Gini number makes it look.

Does BTC truly belong to the people now?,"Not really. BTC started as peer-to-peer money for the people, but over time it got hijacked.

"With Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, you can have it both ways (for some time)","If you believe that a new form of money first needs adoption and use before it becomes a store of value, then you should get some BCH and use it.

If you believe a new money can be a better store of value before being hoovered up by the ultra-rich and taken out of general circulation, but then somehow it can surpass this filter and _still_ become a widely used medium of exchange while retaining the benefits of original Bitcoin:

- practical self-custodianship (""be your own bank"", fully control your own wealth)
- permissionlessness
- low friction to transact, in all respects
- competitive transaction fees
- high (best?) network reliabity
- ability to defend the accruing value of the network through Proof of Work (with increasing difficulty of generating new coins)
- decentralized algorithm to achieve consensus (i.e. mining doesn't collapse to utterly centralized state)
- open protocol and open source development to avoid capture

Then IMO you should consider to also acquire some BTC (and hold it or use it).

If you are not sure about which comes first, the medium of exchange or the store of value, or if indeed they might both grow side by side, then you can acquire _both_ BCH and BTC and use them as you see fit. You can even stabilize (hedge) the fiat value of some of your BCH through [on-chain hedging contracts](https://bchbull.com), if the price charts give you anxiety.

This way, you can have the best of both worlds for a time, until one of them becomes dominant as a medium of exchange, at which time you can live the ""Neo"" meme where you don't have to sell your bitcoins for them to be usable as money.

All the above is, to be sure, my own opinion.

I am just presenting it because very often, maximalists will not even introduce you to the possibility that you can use more than one system at a time.

And if you are thinking along, then this means that Bitcoin (and Bitcoin Cash) is also under pressure from other cryptocurrencies and even things like future CBDCs, and the outcome of the whole thing is still uncertain.

What if Leonardo da Vinci approached Bitcoin in 2025? Thinking like a Renaissance genius 🖋️💰,"Leonardo da Vinci lived centuries ahead of his time—sketching flying machines, designing war machines, and imagining concepts that seemed impossible.

Would he simply invest, or try to invent something even more revolutionary on top of it?

Bitcoin & Inheritance (safely leaving behind BTC to family),"I’ve built a decent Bitcoin stack over the last few years which is safely tucked away in cold storage.

Bitcoin & Inheritance (safely leaving behind BTC to family),Best answer is education. Get all of your family their own wallets.

Encourage them to buy it themselves and go through the process of selling it. Zero reason for them to know about the inheritance.

Now, add to this all the public and private companies, gov and the like, we are up to 3.7 million bitcoin that is now in the hands of institutions, up 1.5% over last month, and of course these institutions trade during work hours and almost always OTC.

This means just under 20% of current btc supply is now institutional, if you don't account for lost coins and other stuff like satoshis coins.

When you accept the reality, you'll understand that gold is noting more than a **""Barbarous Relic""** 1924.

Begging the question, what is money?  In 1912 JP Morgan made the clear distinction between *money* and credit.  When he says, “**Money is Gold, Nothing Else”**. Pre FED.

Unlike credit, and like gold, Bitcoin is not dependent on a third party “coming through” on the obligations.

The reality is gold is not money any more, it was once money, now golds value is for the most part a meme.

**Money is accounting for the exchange of value in an economy.** Our modern economies are broken because we inaptly understand the function of money but allow it to be created at will, and then we work for this money created out of thin air exchanging our energy, wealth and time for nothing but the often irrational will of those who have the power to create it through credit or just plain money printing/mouse clicking.

Our understanding of money is further degraded because we think of it as wealth, chasing money for money's sake.

Gold is coasting on a pre-1913-Central bank narrative. The reality is Gold is valuable in electronics and at today's price it is only about $6 per person that's needed to fulfill that function. That demand is insufficient to justify the current price.

Mt Gox was infamous for being run with absolutely no structure or standards. Many early exchanges were opened by inexperienced devs that were just winging things. It worked great until it didn’t. And it’s not just newb traders who jump in with an exchange without due diligence.

dutch company just raised $23m to buy 1% of bitcoin's entire supply. this is actually insane.,"**tl;dr:** dutch firm just raised $23m to start buying bitcoin, aiming for **1% of total supply (210k btc)**. microstrategy already holds 3%, metaplanet & others raising billions. supply is vanishing, institutions are hoarding, and retail still doesn’t get it

so apparently some dutch crypto firm called amdax just secured $23 million to launch a bitcoin treasury company on amsterdam's euronext stock exchange. their goal? accumulate 1% of all bitcoin that will ever exist.

let me put that in perspective for you: 210,000 btc. worth over $23 billion at current prices.

and this is just one company. from the netherlands. with $23m in initial funding.

the treasury race is getting absolutely wild

here's what's actually happening while everyone's worried about short-term price action:

microstrategy (now ""strategy"") holds 632,457 btc ($69.5 billion)

japanese metaplanet just approved plans to raise $880m for bitcoin purchases

french semiconductor company sequans filed for $200m equity offering this week

tesla, mercadolibre, kulr tech, and a dozen others quietly stacking

we're literally watching the institutional accumulation phase play out in real time, and most retail still doesn't get what's happening.

here's the math that should terrify bears

if amdax hits their 1% target, that's 210,000 btc off the market. permanently.

strategy already took 3% (632,457 btc) off the market.

add in all the other corporate treasuries, plus the btc that's lost forever, plus long-term hodlers who never sell...

how much liquid bitcoin is actually left?

this isn't some moonboy hopium. this is basic supply and demand economics. companies with billions in funding are competing to accumulate a finite asset, and they're not buying it to trade - they're buying it to hold.

the network effect is starting

what started with one crazy ceo (saylor) has become a legitimate corporate strategy. every company that announces a bitcoin treasury validates the model for the next one.

and here's the kicker - we're still early in this trend. most major corporations haven't even considered bitcoin treasury strategies yet.

this changes everything

when you've got companies raising hundreds of millions specifically to buy bitcoin, and their explicit goal is to never sell, the supply dynamics get completely broken.

retail panics over 5% daily moves while institutions are literally trying to corner the market over 5-10 year timeframes.

the question isn't whether bitcoin goes up - it's whether there will be any left to buy when everyone finally figures this out.

all these corporate bitcoin treasuries are creating a massive compliance infrastructure behind the scenes. when you're holding hundreds of millions in btc across multiple jurisdictions like amdax will be, the tax and regulatory reporting gets incredibly complex. companies like awaken.tax are seeing demand explode from corporate clients trying to navigate treasury accounting standards, international tax treaties, and regulatory requirements across different countries.

dutch company just raised $23m to buy 1% of bitcoin's entire supply. this is actually insane.,"Asset management institutions are regulated, have fiduciary responsibilities, and have internal risk and liquidity mandates. Something is only really worth what someone else will pay for it. This narrative only makes sense if the thought process is that the USD-Bitcoin pair essentially only goes up over time, which has little fundamentally backing that argument (also keep in mind the disclosure that past results do not guarantee future returns). All it takes is a larger-scale liquidity crisis or macroeconomic bear market, and institutions will dump the supply of their riskiest assets first, which would be Bitcoin and really the entire cryptocurrency ""asset class"" entirely.

Just FYI, Bitcoin is fundamentally analogous to a Ponzi/MLM, one day the rug will be pulled as entities profit-take. Whales have been bidding it up for the last 15+ years, supported by the macroeconomic environment of lowest interest rates, money printing, the AI bubble, etc. One day this game of musical chairs will end, and who will be the suckers holding the bag? Do not think that Market Cap/unrealized gains is the same as guaranteed total exit liquidity/actualized gains.

Edit - I'm going to detail why Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are like Ponzis/MLMs:

1)  Reliance on new participants - in both Ponzi schemes and MLMs, existing participants benefit only if new participants join and bring in money/exit liquidity. Bitcoin’s price appreciation also depends heavily on new demand coming in (since supply is fixed and disinflationary). Early adopters benefit disproportionately compared to latecomers.

2)  Narrative-driven value: Ponzis rely on a story that convinces people they’re investing in something real, when in fact they’re just funding the exit liquidity of earlier participants. Bitcoin relies on the narrative of being “digital gold,” “inflation hedge,” or “future money.” Besides criminal use cases or valuation as a collectors item, Bitcoin has no ""intrinsic value"". 

3) Exponential recruitment pressure: MLMs require constant recruitment to sustain returns at the top. Bitcoin advocates constantly encourage new buyers (“number go up,” “FOMO”) which echoes MLM-style enthusiasm.",True,12,📰 News

Their goal is very simple. Refuse to implement any L2, in order to drive all transactions on to the L1 chain.

They know that the chain can't scale, but they like driving transactions there because it increases transactions fees and this is good for miners. If the fees become too high, they can increase the block size but that's also good for big miners because it means that only big miners can run nodes.

For eight years non-stop, these big miners have been trying this truly pathetic scam. But they always fail. Nowadays, 99.9% of BTC folks aren't even aware of their existence; the BCH world is like the flat earth community.

q4 bitcoin outlook: are we frontrunning september weakness?,"been digging into some research from network economist timothy peterson and thought it was worth sharing here. the numbers for bitcoin going into q4 are more interesting than they look on the surface.

historically from late august through christmas btc has been positive about 70 percent of the time with an average gain of 44 percent. not bad odds. but what caught my eye isn’t just the upside it’s the pattern.

the september curse. bitcoin has never closed september more than 8 percent higher. ever. it’s usually the weakest month on record. the dip we’re seeing now could just be that seasonality showing up early. some traders are saying we’re frontrunning the usual september chop.

why this year feels different. peterson filtered out the weird years 2017 bubble peak 2018 crash 2020 covid chaos 2022 ftx collapse. what’s left points to a q4 that’s positive but less wild. that lines up we’re not in euphoria but we’re not in crisis either.

also worth watching. bitcoin’s been shadowing gold with a lag lately. gold’s been strong and if that correlation keeps up it’s another tailwind for btc.

my take. the current drop back to july levels doesn’t look scary. if anything it’s a setup for a healthier q4 push rather than some parabolic moon run.

if we do get that typical q4 rally, a lot of people are going to get caught off guard by the tax implications. moving from july lows to potential year-end highs creates massive taxable events if you're trading the swings. platforms like awaken.tax have been seeing more bitcoin traders scramble to understand their liability after missing the complexity of timing these seasonal moves.

In this essay I use the perspective and intention of Szabonian deconstruction, as well as our insights from doing the same with Mises Regression theorem, to highlight Saifedean Ammous’ nefarious use and wrapping of academic scholars work notably including Mises, Hayek, and Nash as well as implicitly Szabo and Satoshi.  
  
Further I highlight that Saifedean's account of how money originated and how moneyness originates in objects is based on an anthropologically inconsistent argument with reference to Jo Walton, “The analogy between Bitcoin and Yapese stone money is based on proposed commonalities that are inaccurate, ill-defined, and/or trivial.“  
  
This essay then gives an example of how nefarious constructions can be ‘un-wrapped’ using Szabonian Deconstruction (properly framed inquiries) and it lays the beginning of my attempt to usefully frame an inquiry into the historical and cultural evolution of objects humanity has used as money as AND money-LIKE things (ie such proto-money, credit, wealth storage etc.).",False,7,

Who's still trying mining solutions in 2025?,"It feels like mining Bitcoin on your own has become way too complicated or expensive. I'll admit, I tried GPU mining in the past, but with today's electricity costs it’s really not worth it anymore.

Who's still trying mining solutions in 2025?,"I have mined something and can say something.
Best thing is to buy btc and hold because with buying you are forced to think that yours 5k/10k mining rig will give you btc forever.
You will be lucky getting what you spent,super lucky if you return even the electricity bill,if you buy a miner you should understand that you will have to sell it in few months and buying another better forever.
If you want to stay more quiet and keep things more you should think of efficiency.
I mean:
Buy a pool,buy mineral oil and put all miners in pool and then pair the pool with your house’s underfloor heating.you will have the house always warm in winter.
In summer you should have solar panels that gives you what you need for 10/12 hours.

Best exchange for purchasing 1 BTC?,"It's not exactly a whale move but... it's a big deal for me and would appreciate any input on getting lowest fees/best rate for this quantity.

Best exchange for purchasing 1 BTC?,"While buying 1 BTC isn't whale-level, it's definitely a large order in the eyes of most people, making fees and price slippage a significant concern. 1. Kraken: Advantages: Established and compliant, with strong liquidity, large orders generally don't incur significant slippage.
Fees: ~0.16% for makers, ~0.26% for takers (which can decrease with trading volume).
Advantages: Supports OTC desks (over-the-counter trading), specializing in large orders and helping you lock in a price.
2. Coinbase Advanced / Coinbase Prime
Advantages: Highest compliance (especially in the US/EU) and top-tier security.
Fees: Standard Coinbase is expensive, but Coinbase Advanced Trade is more reasonable.
Suitable for: If you prioritize compliance and security.
They also offer OTC services specifically for high-volume users.
3. Inance (if available in your region)
Advantages: World's leading liquidity, allowing even large orders to execute smoothly.
Fees: ~0.1% for makers, lowered by using BNB. Ideal for those seeking the lowest rates.

Are Exchanges Still Necessary for Bitcoin Beginners?,"I always hear the phrase ""Not your keys, not your coins,"" and I agree that self-custody is the ideal path. But for those just starting out, many people still turn to exchanges like Binance for their liquidity, variety of pairs, and ease of entry.
