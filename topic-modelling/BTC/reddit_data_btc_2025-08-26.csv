september could be the reset bitcoin traders needed,"looking ahead to september, i think bitcoin’s market structure is finally stabilizing after months of messy chop. august was dominated by liquidations, forced selling, and macro headlines. but under the surface, the flows are shifting in a healthier way. spot inflows from etfs and direct purchases are still consistent. miner selling pressure has cooled after weeks of being a drag. open interest is reset lower, which takes some of the froth out of the system.

right now btc feels less overextended than it did back in july. we’re sitting at support levels that have been tested multiple times, and the derivatives curve is starting to look more neutral instead of over-levered. what matters most to me in september is whether the fed sticks to its softer language from jackson hole. a dovish stance tends to spill directly into bitcoin’s price because liquidity flows toward harder assets when real yields compress.

i’m not predicting a vertical breakout this month. but i do think bitcoin could finally see more organic accumulation instead of constant whipsaws. september may not deliver fireworks, but even a clean base would be bullish heading into q4. anyone else reading the tape this way?",False,0,🤔 Opinion

Bitcoin now makes up 1.7% of all global money... that's actually insane when you think about it,"Just saw this River analysis and had to share. Bitcoin hit 1.7% of global money supply when we peaked at $2.4T market cap earlier this month. They're counting all major fiat currencies ($112.9T) plus gold and other hard money ($25.1T) in that calculation.

We're sitting around $2.29T now so closer to 1.66%, but still... in 16 years we went from literally nothing to nearly 2% of ALL money on earth. That includes every dollar, euro, yen, pound, plus gold reserves.

The Fed stuff is interesting too\*\*:\*\*  
Powell basically confirmed rate cuts are coming at Jackson Hole on Friday. Bitcoin jumped 2% right after his speech and hit $116,000. CME data shows 75% of investors expect a 25 basis point cut in September.

Here's what gets me though - central banks keep printing more fiat while Bitcoin's supply stays fixed. Every time they fire up the money printer, our slice of the pie gets bigger just by existing. We don't even have to do anything.

Gold and Bitcoin are basically eating the lunch of every fiat currency right now. The purchasing power destruction is real and people are waking up to it.

Pretty wild that something that started as a whitepaper is now competing with currencies that took centuries to establish. Makes you wonder what 5% or 10% looks like if this trend continues.

If you're riding this wave and taking profits along the way, just remember to track everything properly. Tools like awaken.tax become more important as Bitcoin's share of global money keeps growing and the tax implications get more complex.

Keeping in mind this: 

* https://jlopp.github.io/unspendable-utxo-calculator

* https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/mining/block-reward

BTC block can fit 4.4k P2PKH 1-to-2 UTXOs currently. Let's say feerate would stay at 1sat/byte long-term: if, like right now, market solves congestions not with fee bidding, but with delaying, custodianship or use of other chains. 225 bytes each UTXO, ~0.01 BTC per filled block

So, if chain usage just stays the same dynamically, then ~50:50 reward to fees ratio in 2056 and ~90:10 in 2072, and smooth sail to ~100:0 in 2100s

And for Bitcoin Cash, thanks to ABLA, it will completely depend on demand for on-chain usage. High demand - it could go to mostly fees-based reward very quickly

btc max price,"Hello everyone,

I've been playing around with some numbers and wanted to share the idea (maybe someone will correct me if I'm wrong).

If we think of a scenario where BTC was the only global money, we can use the equation of exchange:

M \times V = P \times Y

Where:

 = money in circulation (BTC × price).

 = velocity of money (how many times it rotates per year).

 = World nominal GDP.


Global nominal GDP today is around USD 113–114 trillion (IMF 2025).

 The useful supply of BTC is ~18 million (discounting those that have been lost).

So, solving:

\text{BTC Price} = \frac{GDP\_{\text{world}}}{V \times 18,000,000}

If we take typical values ​​of (between 3 and 6), it gives us a range:

V = 3 → ~2.1M USD/BTC

V = 4 → ~1.6M USD/BTC

V = 5 → ~1.3M USD/BTC

V = 6 → ~1.0 M USD/BTC


That is, for BTC to cover the global money function and “replicate” the current money supply, it would need a value in the range of ~1–2 million USD per BTC (perhaps up to 3–4 million if we use a lower money velocity or consider lost BTC).

Obviously, this calculation is theoretical and simplified:

It does not contemplate future GDP growth.

It does not contemplate that States will continue printing fiat currency in the meantime → therefore the “equilibrium price” would move higher over time.

It also does not consider strategic reserves, savings, immobilized BTC, or credit dynamics that could modify the speed.


The intention is to have a more or less well-founded idea of ​​what the BTC ceiling may be until it stabilizes and enters a stage of slow delation that makes it more useful as cash and not so much as a speculative asset or reserve of value.

Does this reasoning make sense or am I missing something key?",False,0,

"Binance froze my funds for 30 days, then sent my withdrawal to the wrong address and blamed it on malware 🤡","I need to share what just happened because it’s absolutely insane and people should know how Binance treats its users.

Binance opened a bogus $197 “dispute” against me and froze ALL my funds for 30 days straight. Every single day I was threatened — my account would be suspended, closed, or funds withheld unless I paid.

After the 30 days expired, they closed the case themselves without my compliance. Fine, I thought, finally done.

I go to withdraw \~$2,300 BTC to my whitelisted Trezor address — the one I had saved long ago. I didn’t type anything, didn’t paste anything, just clicked the dropdown.

Guess what? Binance sends my money to a completely different Bitcoin address that is NOT mine. When I confronted them, they had the audacity to blame it on “malware” on my device. 🤦‍♂️

Here’s the kicker: their own system behavior proves that’s impossible. If the address had been tampered with locally, Binance’s backend would’ve flagged it as a new address and forced network selection + 2FA. That never happened. They admitted themselves that the transaction was processed as whitelisted. Which means the mistake was inside Binance, not on my machine.

So after 30 days of threats and frozen funds, my very next withdrawal gets “misrouted” to a random address, and they blame me. This isn’t an accident anymore — it looks like retaliation for not bowing to their $197 shakedown.

I have the blockchain records, I have the screenshots of their UI logic, I have the chat transcripts where they basically admit it went through as whitelisted.

This company is a predatory custodian that overrides its own security guarantees when it suits them. If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone. And the fact that they’re hiding behind “malware” excuses while bypassing their billion-dollar whitelist infrastructure is beyond laughable.

Yeah, BTC will be 1m dollars, but that single bitcoin won't even buy you a trailer in even the methiest of trailer parks. BTC isn't going up! The US $$$ is going down

Now, obviously massive devaluation of the US dollar (like we are *currently* seeing) is going to be worse than a bull in a china shop, it'll be a little kid in the Eastern Diamondback Rattler store.

Then viola! The billionaires debts are worthless, and even though their money is also worth less, everyone else will be even worse off, and isn't that really what this whole billionaire thing is? These people aren't happy with riches unless someone else has less as a result. They want *relative wealth*. Seriously, had our nation just stopped electing republicans after Nixon (actually pretty progressive for a R), and we had a series of progressive leaders, *these billionaires would be substantially richer,* probably exponentially so.

But it wouldn't be as big of a gap between that wealth and the bottom of the pyramid (suspiciously so) shaped economic system' wealth.

There are plenty of phrases and idioms that are appropriate here, so I'm just going to reiterate the one that (IMO) the most people need to get this through their (between 3.7 × 10\^17 kg/m³ - 6 × 10\^17 kg/m³) skulls.

These people would rather be kings of a wasteland than citizens of a literal utopia.

And they are playing with fire. So many people have lost so much,  we aren't even a year in. Every villain knows you don't take everything from a man, because then you've given him nothing to lose.

No billionaire alive today has ever learned that lesson, *actually had to learn it*, outside of history or literature.

CoinBase ceo brian armstrong says bitcoin could hit $1m by 2030... why its pure and utter overestimation?,"so coinbase's ceo just said bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2030. that's roughly 8x from current levels in about 5 years. sounds wild but let me walk through why this might actually happen.

the math behind it:

bitcoin would need to average about 45% annual gains to hit $1m by 2030. historically, btc has averaged way higher returns over multi-year periods, so the percentage isn't impossible.

but here's what would need to happen:

institutional adoption at scale we're already seeing companies like bitmine accumulating massive eth positions. if similar moves happen with bitcoin at the corporate treasury level, that's a lot of supply getting locked up.

government and sovereign adoption countries are starting to add bitcoin to reserves. if major economies follow el salvador's lead, demand could explode while supply stays fixed at 21 million coins.

currency debasement continues with central banks trapped by government debt (keeping rates artificially low), traditional currencies keep losing purchasing power. bitcoin becomes more attractive as digital gold.

why armstrong might be onto something:

coinbase sees institutional demand that retail doesn't

they see the actual money flows happening behind the scenes

their business only works if crypto succeeds, so they're motivated to be realistic

bitcoin's fixed supply becomes more obvious as more people want it

why he might be wrong:

regulatory crackdowns could stunt growth

competing cryptocurrencies could eat bitcoin's market share

technical issues or security problems could derail adoption

economic crashes typically hit risk assets hardest

my take:

$1m sounds nuts until you remember we just went from $15k to $124k in less than 3 years. that's already an 8x move in a shorter timeframe.

the real question isn't whether bitcoin can 8x again - it's whether the stuff that got us here (money printing, institutions buying, currencies getting weaker) keeps happening for another 5 years.

if central banks stay trapped by debt and keep rates low while governments keep spending, armstrong's prediction might actually be conservative.

what this means for coinbase users:

whether you believe the $1m target or not, coinbase is clearly positioning for massive growth. they're building infrastructure assuming crypto gets way bigger than it is today.

Indeed, it isn't impossible in the sense that the probability of it happening is not exact zero.

That said, let's check the plot of averaged annualized returns of BTC. We can easily see that the average annualized logarithmic returns over four-year periods were around 103% in 2016. As opposed to that, in 2023, the annualized average logarithmic returns over four-year periods were around 37%. Moreover, the annualized average logarithmic returns were quite steadily decreasing during the 2016-2023 period.

are we looking at a bitcoin cycle top in the next 2-3 months?,"glassnode just dropped some analysis that has me thinking about where we are in this cycle. the data is pointing to bitcoin being in a historically late phase right now.

the numbers:

bitcoin went from $15,500 in november 2022 to $124,500 last week - that's a 700% rally. when you compare this timing to previous cycles, we're apparently about 2-3 months away from where past cycle tops occurred.

currently 91% of all bitcoin is in profit and has been above the +1 standard deviation band for 273 days. that's the second longest stretch on record, only behind the 2015-2018 cycle that hit 335 days.

profit taking patterns:

long-term holders (people who held for 155+ days) have been taking profits at levels comparable to previous euphoric phases. this kind of selling pressure typically happens near cycle tops.

rekt capital says if bitcoin follows historical halving cycles, the peak would be mid-september to mid-october 2025. that's literally 1-2 months away.

current price action:

bitcoin got rejected at $114,000 yesterday after bouncing from $112,000 support. if we lose that $110,000-$112,000 zone, analysts are saying we could drop back into the $90,000-$100,000 range pretty quickly.

what this means:

look, nobody knows exactly when tops happen until after they're done. but when you have:

700% gains from cycle lows

91% of supply in profit for 273 days straight

long-term holders selling at euphoric levels

price getting rejected at key resistance

it starts looking like we might be closer to the end than the beginning of this run.

my take:

this doesn't mean bitcoin crashes tomorrow. we could still push higher and extend this cycle. but the risk/reward is definitely shifting. if you've been riding this from the lows, maybe consider taking some profits. if you are taking profits, make sure you're tracking everything properly for tax season. tools like awaken.tax can help you stay on top of the reporting side while you focus on the trading decisions.

the $110,000-$112,000 zone is probably make or break right now. hold that and we might get another push higher. lose it and things could get interesting fast.

BCH halving is shaping up as one of Q3’s sleeper trades,"Bitcoin Cash is quietly setting up one of the most interesting plays this quarter. After spiking past $600 earlier in August, BCH has cooled into the mid-$500s with the market pullback. For some that looks like weakness - for others, it looks like the kind of entry point halvings are made for.  
  
The event is only weeks away. Block rewards get cut, new supply tightens, and historically these moments have sparked explosive short-term rallies. Technicals still lean bullish (MACD crossover, RSI not overbought, volumes steady), so the structure is there.  
  
What makes it even better is that BCH is one of the few majors with an active incentive to hold right now. On Nеxо, BCH balances are earning daily compounding interest plus an extra 3% in kind through November. For anyone sitting on BCH into the halving, that’s effectively stacking while waiting for the supply shock narrative to unfold.

Calls to Action. Thoughts on Ensuring Success of Peer-to-Peer Cash,"Let's define terms

16 years have passed since Genesis block, Bitcoin is ticking in two branches of BTC and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash is a Bitcoin, it's more elegant chain, but has lesser network effect. ASERT and ABLA are important improvements. I consider Segwit and RBF sand in the Bitcoin machine. By p2p cash on this forum I mean the crypto iteration, Bitcoin 2015 and BCH, if you will. By network effect of a given crypto I mean amount of people engage with protocol in various manner, in concentric circles: being aware, talking, having coins, running a business, creating infrastructure of hardware and software

My estimation is that network effect of BTC is much greater that this of DOGE, BCH, XMR, LTC (other biggest open blockchains) and ETH (most decentralized private money, closed in 2022) 

I don't agree that custodianship trend is caused by higher fees on BTC, p2p cash is the problem, so to speak. I think it's due to level of sophistication that is needed to securely manage one's private keys. BIP39 was important step there long ago. But nothing significant happened since. Managing keys with Electon Cash or Selene on BCH is fundamentally the same as doing so on Electrum back in 2015 over unified Bitcoin chain - from operational security standpoint. This is my perspective: while both operating coins and teaching willing people - technical barrier is just too high


User DangerHighVoltage111 (now deleted for some reason) was responding to me in several threads about importance of p2p cash philosophy. And he created a thread with a call to action of not listening to sirens, presumably myself included - and to teach people

My post is a call to action as well:

* **education**: as DangerHighVoltage111 called, I also call for teaching willing people whenever possible, maybe I am simply wrong about severity of key management problem and growth of network effect of BCH would take care of everything

* **uncensorable speech**: there is tremendous unrealized value of uncensorable speech, potential to overlay all content on the Internet with built-in monetization and user-moderated rating system and commentary, serverless, as hashes on chain (BitTorrent seems the best fit) and well-thought UI unwrapping it: allowing users to bootstrap from zero, without DNS-dependence, locally follow and engage in monetization, donate to content providers. Something, that Memo fell short off, extremely unfortunately. I'm calling for smarter people than myself to develop it (meanwhile, I need capital, and hopefully will have extra at some point - to sponsor it)

PoW, low fees, UTXO system and improvements in OP_RETURN make BCH the best posed open blockchain for this

Hopefully, shattering god-awful ad-based data mining Internet of 2025 to pieces. Admittedly, a big ask

* **key management**: I call for capable people to think about jump to BIP39 and standing still since then, maybe software solution exists which could turn crypto p2p cash into a tool that is as easy to manage as physical cash - which is life saving for poorest productive people across the world

I stand for maximizing economic freedom, and I also stand for not being blind about dynamics in the real world. I'm both heavily allocated in BTC and not giving up on BCH for a reason

> I don't agree that custodianship trend is caused by higher fees on BTC, 

As I have said elsewhere I believe it's mainly, that there is no pressing need to move away from custodians at the moment (as that's where the majority get their coins, why move?), combine that with general apathy and finally as you say the level of competence needed.


> p2p cash is the problem

I would agree, but not in the way that I think you mean


I would say the lack of '*a p2p cash* ***usecase***' is the problem. 


There are not enough places where one can spend their p2p cash at the moment. And if there are places that sell something you want, it's not easy to hunt down, I just spent a couple of hours tracking down somewhere I could spend $200+ (BCH) on internet services.


The above combined with the fact that custodians don't like people **paying directly** for services from their wallet, and (imo) '*don't like*' is just the start... **The friction has to increase (inevitable imo) combined with the actual opportunity to use your coins**



It's a chicken and egg situation, **some people have to go first supporting those willing to either take BCH directly** or use services that accept BCH (former being the ultimate goal, but the latter is a start).


**So I believe a well curated list of services etc that accept BCH directly/indirectly would be a good start**


> I think it's due to level of sophistication that is needed to securely manage one's private keys. 



Given a truly low fee chain, one can experiment with just ~$1, making many tiny transactions **learning how things work** with minimal risk.


Can the average Joe learn? - I just watched an Orangutan on YT that had learned to drive a Golf Cart around a zoo... 


People are more capable than most think, sadly learned helplessness is a thing, would ancient scholars believe world literacy was possible at todays level?


The Bitcoin Dot Com wallet **used** to be easy to use (pre spam) and a good starting point. A decent wallet experience is certainly needed for those starting out (thanks Selene). 


Then build intuition about how things work with a couple of dollars on Electron Cash (desktop) for the intrepid.



> BIP39 was important step there long ago. But nothing significant happened since. Managing keys with Electon Cash or Selene on BCH is fundamentally the same as doing so on Electrum back in 2015 over unified Bitcoin chain - from operational security standpoint. 

The rise of hardware wallets has been a significant step for security in the interim.


The next step will be harnessing the secure enclave  on smartphones to act as hardware wallets. see Graphene OS's use of Titan M on pixels (not directly crypto related yet)




Perhaps the ability for my secure element to talk to yours, sending over my 'secrets' encrypted with **my** biometrics,  inaccessible to you but recoverable on 'standardised biometric hardware'. An Apple 'keychain' like solution shows the way.



> This is my perspective: while both operating coins and teaching willing people - **technical barrier is just too high**


Yep it's not easy, and as yet no clear path. The solution (for the masses) is probably technological,


But how do people start learning with traditional money, they are given a small amount at a young age and allowed to play, it can even be a walled garden where coins cannot be lost as they are encumbered with an overseer covenant (programmability ftw)


The path to full decentralisation is probably a lot longer than many would like.




> User DangerHighVoltage111 (now deleted for some reason) was responding to me in several threads about importance of p2p cash philosophy. And he created a thread with **a call to action of not listening to sirens, presumably myself included** - and to teach people

All voices are welcome, especially those who argue in good faith for or against BCH.


But even the rabid Trolls have their place, ~~under the bridge~~ keeping us grounded honing our point of view, and as we know 

* '*An infinite number of Trolls bangin away on their keyboards are bound to hit on something of value sooner or later*'. God bless em!


> education: as DangerHighVoltage111 called, I also call for teaching willing people whenever possible, maybe I am simply wrong about severity of key management problem and growth of network effect of BCH would take care of everything


Though I don't think 'key management' is the thing '*mainly*' holding BCH back, I would say it's still a big worry even for those who have been here a while. We all become complacent, backups backups (but not *TOO* many!), check your backups...



> uncensorable speech: there is tremendous unrealized value of uncensorable speech, potential to overlay all content on the Internet with built-in monetization and user-moderated rating system and commentary, serverless, as hashes on chain (BitTorrent seems the best fit) and well-thought UI unwrapping it: allowing users to bootstrap from zero, without DNS-dependence, locally follow and engage in monetization, donate to content providers. Something, that Memo fell short off, extremely unfortunately. I'm calling for smarter people than myself to develop it 

Yes, hopefully the next big thing in social media, a truly decentralised platform, we used to have a tipping bot around here and imo it was one of BCH's greatest ambassadors, but reddit stopped it from working afaik.


> (meanwhile, I need capital, and hopefully will have extra at some point - to sponsor it)


Good luck, 


u/Marc_De_Mesel single handedly supported just such a platform giving away countless BCH (big thanks to Marc and hope he is well)


> PoW, low fees, UTXO system and improvements in OP_RETURN make BCH the best posed open blockchain for this

The inherent scalability of the UTXO model (world scale throughput... TBC) combined with the richness of the scripting language (Cashtokens) truly opens the doors for **permissionless** p2p cash for the whole world.


The permissionless bit comes from the fact that **anybody** can **actually** build almost anything on top with such scripting capabilities **without having to petition the community or the Devs for a consensus change**

Did I pay this 5000+ sats fee by myself?,"Might be a stupid question.

Want to do p-2-p but don't want to do something stupid by accident and lose my security deposit on Bisq. Was forced to use an exchange.

I sent BTC from the exchange to a wallet.

An app in Watch-Only mode for that wallet shows ""Transaction Confirmed 2/6""

The amount sent from the exchange is $0.68 higher than the amount displayed as in possession on the watch-only wallet. This loss is just the network fee which I was already warned about. That's fine.

The problem is, before it said ""2/6 confirmations"", it said there was another fee of over 5000 sats, and that, in USD, is over 10% of the amount I had sent. Is that representative of the entire block being mined, so other senders online right now are sharing the burden of that 5000+ sats fee with me, and my share of the burden was only $0.68? Or have I lost 5000 sats from somewhere (the exchange, the receiver's wallet once we reach stage 6/6, something else?)

On mempool, something that anyone can access, the same 5000+ fee is displayed. This suggests it's shared.
