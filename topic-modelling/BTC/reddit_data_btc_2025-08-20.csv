"Don't become complacent. ""The market"" will not decide to use p2p for you.","There is a dangerous notion going around that ""the market"" is just not ready for p2p cash and you should just lean back and do nothing and wait until ""the market"" or the people are ready. This notion is dangerous and completely misunderstands the nature of Bitcoin as p2p cash. It preys on your natural tendency of inaction.

Let me make a comparison. Everyone immediately understands the freedom that comes with your own car. But driving around in traffic, taking care of your car also involves a LOT of responsibility that you wouldn't have when someone else would do all this for you. That's why people use caps or busses. And yet while using them they still understand the freedom a self owned car brings. 

P2P cash is not a product that just needs a ready market like an Iphone. P2P cash is a freedom that comes with responsibility. We are in the stage where there are cars but no paved roads yet. Driving this care is difficult and the freedom still limited, yet all the responsibilities are there. To get over this hill, p2p cash needs to be taught. People need to understand the freedom that comes when you accept the responsibilities. And the roads need to be paved. 

If we sit back and do nothing, nothing will change. ""The market"" can print as many units as it wants to prop up false prophets that keeps you in the system without freedom forever. They prey on the greed of people to rather be rich than free. If people don't understand the freedom, safety and literal peace that comes with better, sound money, we won't get over that initial hill.

So, don't be complacent, don't listen to the sirens, teach someone about p2p cash today.",False,17,

Psychological: For humans, predicting Bitcoin’s future is impossible. Our knowledge is limited by our own experiences, and we can’t foresee the actions of other powerful entities. That makes it less of a science and more of a mystery game.

Price wise: I’ve got a feeling Bitcoin will swing up and down toward the 200k mark. At that point, the whales will decide whether to crush it or let it keep growing. As long as they don’t all dump their holdings, BTC will likely rebound. Many of them are already sitting on more than a 3x, so the game is in their hands. It’s pretty clear they’re the ones creating the waves—buying, selling, wiping out longs and shorts along the way. In the end, it’s all a gamble. I can imagine having BTC recessions 😂.",True,1,

The coins are getting paired with a LNG Future to cash out a lease holder, but the energy was burned on site and there is no future obligation to the token holder once the ASIC miner has paid the well operator. 

Energy, driven by fracking, is the largest industry in the US. Maxis have no understanding of economics if they can't see what they're buying.

When enough people catch onto the scam, and the lease holders can't cash out onto naive market, they'll shut down their wells, and they won't need to back USDT or BTC anymore.

Bitcoin Art - How Do You Even Do It?,"I’ve recently noticed more artists dedicating their work entirely to Bitcoin and crypto. *That got me wondering: how do you even approach making art about Bitcoin, and why?*  
  
I invited one of these artists for a chat (turned into a lot longer than expected lol). We talked about his process, motivations, and the intersection of art and Bitcoin.  
Curious to hear your thoughts: have you seen or collected Bitcoin-inspired art before? What do you think makes art “**Bitcoin art**”?

The only way to find out the value of money is to (try and) spend it.,"This obviously relates to Bitcoin as well as traditional money.

But when I did have this thought last night, it wasn't primarily inspired by Bitcoin - it was because I need to purchase some imported equipment for construction, and I was thinking about how much I needed to spend on that, and how the value of my currency related to the value of the products I was going to buy.

And how prices - especially for construction materials - keep going up and up. 

We (society in general) have practically come to accept this inflation as ""normal"". Most people are resigned to thinking they can't do anything about this.

But we can.

Bitcoin came along to help us. To fix money.

And Bitcoin has already improved many peoples' lives (I'll skip those who stupidly gambled away fortunes against constant better advice not to invest more than they can safely lose).

Bottom line:

A Bitcoin that you can't spend on things you need, is useless, and you'll find that out when you need to spend, which we all need to do at some points in life. Unless you're some hermit in which case you likely don't need Bitcoin, in which case congratulations for moving past a money-based economy but please explain how society in general with division of labor can work without some accounting in a wider economy.",False,6,🤔 Opinion

"BTC is a decade behind, BCH is the solution","Love how people are asking if this is a joke, as if it’s not very, very clear by now that what started as a P2P network to transact value between people without the need for banks has been turned into yet another tool in the search for yield. 

Bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin in terms of what the original white paper laid out. BTC is just like any other equity now and it’s boring and sad. You buy it from someone else, typically a fucking bank now (the irony is insane) with the hope that you’ll sell it for more than you bought it for. That’s not what Bitcoin was made to do but here we are with everyone circlejerking each other about how they’ll make a quick easy dollar off Bitcoin.

That's it. It never said it intended to be an in-person replacement for high volume cash purchases of cups of coffee.

Whitepaper also said quite succinctly: ""The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity."" Not coincidentally just like TCP/IP itself, which is a simple protocol that cares about getting a packet from A to B. Layers on top, like HTTP and SSL, do more complex tasks.

The amount of non-technical people blindly following the religion of BCH is... well, not surprising, considering how there's also a massive industry of shitcoins that could only exist with that same blindness.

Robustness. Security. This is what matters, and BTC's protocol is the right kind of ""good enough"" with the massive first mover network effect needed to maintain its security.

It's so sad. If instead of human greed chasing the mythical lightning-in-a-bottle fast riches of buying the ""next bitcoin"" early, everyone had rallied around bitcoin as the only necessary cryptocurrency, it would probably already be at mainstream adoption phase.",True,0,

Guy who sold part of his Bitcoin to renovate his house,"I recently saw a story about a guy who sold part of his Bitcoin to renovate his house — and he said he feels no regret at all.

It made me think: maybe it’s not always about leaving this world with the biggest wallet, but about actually using some of those gains to improve your life today.

Life is short. Use your gains wisely.

- We’ve sold some for a trip around the world with the kids
- We’ve sold some to for my wife’s childhood dream purchase

1. Renovate my old house, making it nicer to live in and increasing the value
2. Buy a new, much nicer house (additional deposit/down payment)
3. Pay for an engagement ring and “holiday of a lifetime” type trip with my then-girlfriend

I still have a little left, but I won’t be buying any yachts with what I have even if it goes 100x from today (unlikely). If it goes 10x then that’ll be a nice boost to our finances but not enough to eg stop working

Where can I buy bitcoin at the price it's at?,"Other comments have answered why there is no ""actual"" price. But for specific instructions, if you want the best price:

1. You must use a platform that lets you place a limit order on its order book (Coinbase Advanced, Kraken Pro, etc.)

2. You must place a ""buy"" limit order at a specific price. There are usually helper buttons that auto fill the current ""mid market"" price or select 1%, 2%, etc. over that price.

3. Usually you will get a fee discount if you place a ""post only"" limit order. This places your intent to buy on the order book and means you are a **maker**, which Exchanges like because it creates market liquidity. These orders get filled by **takers**, i.e. people who want the order to complete immediately and opt to pay a higher fee.

The big caveat here: if you're a maker, there's no guarantee you get your purchase. E.g. Bitcoin is $115,000 ""mid market"" and you put a post-only buy at $115,000.

Qubic aimed to get 51% hashrate and announced that if they did, they were going to mine empty blocks on XMR, disrupting the reliable functioning of the network.

Although Qubic has not stopped mining XMR at this point, and their attack (mostly through FUD on social media) succeeded to damage the XMR price a little, XMR has remained noticeably resilient on the market.

""We can always increase the blocksize"" is what smallblockers have been saying since 2014. We've heard it countless times, but in that timespan, BTC network has been congested several times, on occasion months at a time, with no action upon those ideals.

Market continues to use centralize solutions for payments even after debt paradigm dies. BTC goes on, BCH slides down

* p2p cash would become much more important in the mid-term, but small blockers would continue to dominate vanguards in BTC. BTC may stall, BCH may gain. In a severe case BCH gain may cause BTC downspiral

* p2p cash would be such of importance that all people engaged with BTC would be convinced, and new vanguard will push small blockers aside. Including possible quick shift if it would be easily observable that BCH started to gain network effect because of p2p cash demand. BTC may gain much more. BCH slides

Is August 2025 still a good time to buy Bitcoin before the cycle peak? Opinions wanted,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been researching **Bitcoin market cycles**, which seem to follow the halving events (every \~4 years). The last halving was in April 2024, and historically Bitcoin tends to rally for 12–18 months after, usually reaching a **cycle peak** before entering a longer bear market.

Some analysts suggest the **peak of this current cycle could happen around October–November 2025**. That got me thinking:

* Right now, it’s **August 2025**, and we’re clearly in the bullish phase.
* If I buy now, theoretically there’s still room to grow before that potential peak.
* But after the peak, we could be facing a big correction (like in 2014, 2018, and 2022).

So my questions for you:

* Do you think **August 2025 is still a good entry point for BTC**?
* What kind of **exit strategies** do you recommend to avoid getting stuck in the next bear market?
* Is it smarter to do **take-profit gradually before November**, or just keep holding until the next halving in 2028?

I’d love to hear your thoughts — I know this community has both long-term holders and active traders, so different perspectives would be super helpful.

A Better Configuration for Bitcoin Mining With Miner Control Panel,"I actually had an idea when i visited Bitcoin P2Pool V2 project https://github.com/pool2win/p2pool-v2
So its kind of like combining Gupaxx and Awesome Miner, but aimed at Bitcoin with Stratum V2. The concept is a stand-alone control platform that always uses SV2, so miners can control block templates without extra hassle. It bundles a DATUM template manager, an SV2 proxy with job negotiation, P2Pool support, and a Bitcoin full node into one GUI. Setup is simple: during onboarding you pick which backend to connect through SV2, local P2Pool (bundled), the remote P2Pool mesh, or an external SV2-compatible pool. The wizard would walk through node setup, P2Pool config, and backend handshake, then auto-discover ASICs on the LAN, log into their web interfaces with stored username/password, and push configs so they point to the software automatically.

Like Awesome Miner, the GUI would handle miner management in one place, showing hashrate, stale/orphan rates, latency, fee deltas, and accept/reject logs, while letting you group miners and assign different template policies. Like Gupaxx, everything would be bundled including the node, P2Pool, and SV2, so even non-technical operators can run it out of the box. Operators could choose from DATUM presets (max fees, low orphan, censorship-resistant, neutral) or create custom templates with rules for txid pinning, fee floors, package acceptance, or coinbase preferences. Templates could be chained with failover (Template1 → Template2 → backend default → secondary backend), with watchdogs reverting automatically if stale/orphan budgets or mempool sanity checks are breached.

Packaging could be either a stand-alone controller for people with their own node/P2Pool, or a bundled suite ready to run on a mini-PC or node appliance (Umbrel, Start9OS, Linux flatpak). Security would be built-in: TLS for SV2 links, minimal RPC permissions, backup and restore of configs, and log retention controls. By enforcing SV2 and integrating with P2Pool, variance smoothing stays intact while restoring transaction selection to miners, aligning closer to Satoshi’s “1 CPU = 1 vote.” Pools still validate and pay, but they no longer dictate transaction policy. It would look like the below image. The only reason imo miners saw p2pool to complicated and have no predictable income compared to centralized pool where the only thing they needed is a UI for them to work on plug and play. ",False,2,

What type of encryption am I looking at.,"Before I posted this I looked at a couple pgp examples and they had - and _ in the random letters and number block so it doesn’t look like pgp (as far as I can tell)

Please note the block letters and numbers and the 64 character line are in capital letters. I’m quite sure that wouldn’t have been a mistake and forced all upper case. 

I found 3 btc addresses from back in 2013 and they gave a bit of btc in them (.19 btc enough to make me want to get it back). each had a short wallet identifier name. The first one was 1GAME then next line my email addess then below that 1300 random letters and numbers (no spaces or dashes or underscores) after that was a line of 64 random letters and numbers (no spaces or dashes etc). 

I know this is something to do with my old accounts at blockchain.info which has become blockchain.com. It would have possibly been some type of backup thing they asked me to save at blockchain.info back in the day?
I can’t get in by username and password as I lost the passwords long ago and I wasn’t registered in there to simply get a password reset as it doesn’t work that way. I hope someone can help me somehow work out what these random number blocks mean. (Each is 1300 digits).

Thanks to Paytaca for this nice informative intro-level video.

> The Story of Bitcoin Cash follows the journey of a digital currency from its origins in Bitcoin to its own path as peer-to-peer electronic cash.

The film begins in 2008, during a global financial crisis, when Bitcoin emerged as a new kind of money — decentralized, borderless, and independent from banks or governments. As Bitcoin grew, so did debates over its direction. By 2017, those debates led to a split into two chains:

> Bitcoin (BTC) – evolving into a secure reserve asset for large holders and institutions Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – focusing on fast, low-cost transactions for everyday use

> This documentary explores the early days of Bitcoin, the block size debates, the creation of Bitcoin Cash, and how both chains have evolved. It also highlights how Paytaca and the global Bitcoin Cash community are building tools and adoption for peer-to-peer electronic cash.

retail is shifting from btc to altcoins and it might signal bitcoin buyer exhaustion,"been watching some interesting data this week. retail sentiment toward crypto jumped hard but it's not going into bitcoin anymore. analysts think this could mean btc buyers are getting tired.

the numbers are pretty clear

crypto sentiment index went from 0.23 to 0.91 in just one week according to bitwise's max shannon. that's a massive jump but here's the interesting part - google searches for altcoins and ethereum hit multiyear highs.

this pattern looks similar to what we saw before previous bear markets. people start looking for alternatives after bitcoin runs up, which usually means the btc party might be ending soon.

bitcoin hit some turbulence

btc dropped below $118k on thursday after treasury secretary scott bessent said the government had no plans to buy more bitcoin for the strategic reserve. he walked that back pretty quick though, saying they're still exploring ways to add btc.

fear and greed index dropped from 68 to 59, moving out of greed territory into neutral. still elevated but not euphoric anymore.

what buyer exhaustion actually means

when buying pressure starts decreasing while selling pressure stays the same, you get buyer exhaustion. basically fewer people want to buy at these high prices so capital starts rotating into other assets.

we're seeing this with retail interest shifting toward altcoins and ethereum. classic pattern that often happens after bitcoin makes new highs.

september altcoin season incoming

coinbase institutional's david duong thinks we're setting up for full altcoin season as we approach september. altcoin season means at least 75% of the top 50 altcoins outperform bitcoin over 90 days.

the altcoin season index climbed from 33 to 42 this week but still needs to hit 75 to officially trigger altseason.

michaël van de poppe from mn trading thinks altcoins could see 100-150% gains in their first serious run, similar to what ethereum just did.

what this means for traders

if bitcoin buyers are actually exhausted, we might see:

btc consolidation or pullback in the near term

capital rotating into ethereum and altcoins

potential altcoin season starting in september

bitcoin possibly finding support and resuming later

the broader crypto narrative is still intact with things like solana etf decisions coming in october. policy developments remain favorable.

but short term, retail attention shifting away from bitcoin toward alts is usually a sign that btc's current run might need to take a breather.

not saying bitcoin is done, just that the easy money phase might be over for now while altcoins get their turn. for anyone active in this market, it’s also a good time to keep tax reporting in check platforms like awaken.tax make it a lot easier to stay compliant without slowing down your trading.",False,7,🤔 Opinion

For context, tether had collapsed two weeks prior, there was some stuff that happened on Bitcoin Cash in November 2018, and for Donald Wilson personally and professionally, a case brought by the CFTC seeking to ban him from trading for life was dismissed with prejudice at the end of Nov. 2018.

"Excerpt on 51% attacks and ""Goldfinger"" attacks from a talk with Donald Wilson at University of Chicago on November 9th 2018.","This is why BCH is the only coin with any incentive to be 51% attacked.  

51% attacking a chain renders it valueless so no one would ever try it on a chain where they expect to gain value from pirating transactions. 

However I would say there is a real incentive for any large traditional entity to 51% attacking BCH into the ground and eat the cost just do it no longer poses a threat to, say, BTC. 

How much that would cost is about as well documented as the centralization of nodes on a non 1MB bitcoin blockchain, if you know what I’m saying…",True,4,

At 51% you still only have 50/50 coin-toss odds of successfully executing your attack in the next block. Technically, you'd need closer to 85% to *run the tables* long enough to have any sort of meaningful impact.  And that's really expensive.

If Goldfinger did have the funds, the best he could do is disrupt BCH operations by mining empty blocks (win but doesn't including any trxs). However, since BTC supports big blocks, any backlog will be quickly relieved if he doesn't have enough peak hashing to sustain winning every block.

Not only does he incur the cost of the attack, but the opportunity cost of not mining BTC.",True,1,

4. Solana
5. Chainlink
6. Tron

"bitcoin hits new ATH with 124K, How high are we looking at in 2025?","so we're past the $124k mark and honestly, the numbers i'm seeing for where bitcoin could end up by december are pretty wild. been digging through everything, from big institutions to crypto analysts to trading algorithms, and figured i'd share what the consensus looks like.

Majority of analysts are believeing in somewhat range of 130k-145k range. this is kind of a safe instituitional forecast, but with bitcoin we have seen how wrong the analysts predictions can be in actually good sense.\\

mid-range optimists are throwing around $150k-$170k targets. investing haven's stretched targets go up to $174k-$181k.  the moonshot predictions are getting crazy though. peter brandt is calling $200k. anthony scaramucci thinks $170k is doable.

what's driving this? the institutional money keeps pouring in—blackrock's eth etf alone hit $10 billion. we've got the strategic bitcoin reserve thing happening in washington. the regulatory clarity act is moving through congress. supply shock from the halving. corporate treasuries adding btc.

somewhere between $130k-$160k feels realistic if current momentum holds. the $200k+ calls need everything to go perfect, but honestly? after watching bitcoin hit $124k when most people thought $100k was ambitious, maybe ""impossible"" targets aren't so impossible anymore.

"Like I'm 5: What are crypto ""layers"" and how do they work?","Layer 1 refers to transactions that happen ""on chain"". That is, as ""natively"" as possible in your cryptocurrency of choice.

In other words, Layer 1 transactions will be forever recorded in the blockchain and will enjoy the full security and reliability of the cryptocurrency's source code and cryptography.

Layer 2 are technologies that build ""on top of"" Layer 1, meaning you can do transactions *outside* of the blockchain, which enables things that may not be possible in the original blockchain, such as transactions with ""sub-satoshi"" units of a Bitcoin (so a Bitcoin could be cut up into further smaller bits than regularly allowed, which might be useful for example for a streaming service payment). Of course, by using Layer 2 technology, it means you are acting ""outside"" of your cryptocurrency, so things can get risky, and you have to trust that third-party code is safe and that the providers of the Layer 2 technology are honest and will not censor or steal your money.

It should be noted that Layer 2 technology is worthwhile, but it should exist to *extend and expand* functionality, not enable basic functionality or be a band-aid fix. Lightning network is interesting technology, but it can't fix BTC's problems: [https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network)

"Like I'm 5: What are crypto ""layers"" and how do they work?","""Layer 2"" adds either additional capabilities or additional throughput that can't be handled on the base (Layer 1) chain.  

Some ""Layer 2"" use the native token of the base chain, and are only a technology built on top.   (Example:   The BTC Lightning Network)   
But some ""Layer 2"" use their own token.   (Example: Arbitrum is built on Ethereum)   So if you transact on Arbitrum, you need to spend ""Arbitrum"" as ""gas"" to pay the transaction fee. 

Not exactly a ""layer 2"" thing, but the weird thing about a lot of the crypto economy, is that ""Ethereum"" isn't often used as the underlying currency to transact.  It's often using stablecoin tokens such as USDT to do the actual transaction, and the the Ethereum, is just used to pay the ""gas"" fee to transact.  

  
BTW, the Lightning Network is a complete joke, and doesn't work half the time.   Bitcoin should be able to easily scale to VisaNet levels without the need for ""Layer 2"", but Bitcoin was sabotaged.

"UTXO-Z: High-Performance UTXO Database for Bitcoin Cash by Fernando Pelliccioni, veteran BCH developer & Knuth node lead","> __Abstract__

> UTXO-Z is a purpose-built database system designed to overcome the performance bottlenecks that prevent Bitcoin Cash from scaling to global payment volumes. As transaction validation requires rapid access to unspent outputs (UTXOs), traditional key-value stores like LevelDB become the primary bottleneck when processing thousands of transactions per second—a requirement for worldwide adoption.

> This paper presents UTXO-Z, which replaces general-purpose databases with a domain-specific architecture optimized for UTXO access patterns. The system employs cache-optimized data structures, value-based segmentation, and generational storage to minimize memory indirection and maximize throughput. By storing complete output data inline and leveraging temporal locality through deferred lookups, UTXO-Z eliminates the performance penalties of pointer-based storage systems.

> Benchmarks demonstrate that UTXO-Z achieves 2.5× higher throughput than LevelDB during blockchain synchronization, processing up to 290,000 inputs and 320,000 outputs per second on a single thread. Under concurrent access, the system reaches 33 million lookups per second for recent outputs (45× faster than LevelDB) and 1.5 million lookups per second for the complete pipeline (2× faster). These performance gains, achieved through careful attention to memory layout and cache efficiency, provide the foundation necessary for Bitcoin Cash to scale as a global payment system serving billions of users.
