"bitcoin just reclaimed key resistance and analysts are calling for a ""massive move"" - shorts getting liquidated hard","btc touched $112,900 this morning and the technical setup is looking explosive. we're seeing key resistance levels flip to support and short liquidations are piling up.

the liquidation carnage

$14.32 million in btc short positions got liquidated within one hour as price broke back above $112k. shorts are getting absolutely destroyed and there's clear rotation out of bearish positions heading into us jobs data.

key levels everyone's watching

$112k is the critical level - michael van de poppe calling it ""another massive long opportunity"" if we break above. rekt capital says $113k needs to be reclaimed to ""fully confirm the breakout"".

the liquidity zones are sitting at $111,500-$113,000 with more clusters extending to $115k. if we clear these levels, the next move could be violent.

macro catalyst building

us jobs report drops today and traders are expecting it could show labor market weakness. 99.4% probability of 25bp fed rate cut in september according to cme fedwatch.

here's the setup: weak jobs data -rate cut certainty -risk-on rally. ""the us now has more unemployed people than job openings"" - this could force fed's hand.

technical momentum shifting

analyst skew noted ""$100m bought back"" and ""clear rotation out of shorts"". the bid depth held and we're seeing real demand step in above $110k support.

if jobs data comes in weak as expected, we could see the perfect storm of technical breakout + macro catalyst driving the next leg higher.

the bigger picture

this feels like the moment where macro and technicals align. shorts are trapped, institutions are positioned for rate cuts, and we're testing the upper bounds of this consolidation range.

either we break out here and see that ""massive move"" analysts are calling for, or we reject again and test lower support. but with fed policy turning dovish and technical momentum building, the odds favor the bulls.

what's your take? is this the breakout above $112k that sets up the next major rally or just another false break before more chop?",False,1,

Bitcoin Is Being Poisoned From Within.,"I don‚Äôt think enough people are paying attention to what‚Äôs happening with Bitcoin Core right now and it‚Äôs something everyone running a node needs to know about

There‚Äôs a big change coming in October that will raise the OP_RETURN data limit from 80 bytes up to 100 thousand bytes or more. If you‚Äôre new to Bitcoin, OP_RETURN is the part of a transaction where people can add extra data that is not related to moving bitcoin around. This was always kept very small to prevent the blockchain from being misused and to keep Bitcoin focused on money instead of becoming a permanent storage layer for unrelated content

Now the plan is to remove those limits and get rid of the filters that previously stopped non-standard data from flooding the network. This is serious because it means much larger pieces of arbitrary content can now be added directly to the blockchain. This is permanent and every full node stores this data forever. This is not a theory. In the past, sensitive and highly inappropriate material has been inserted into the blockchain. It was often disguised or encoded but these changes make it much easier for bad actors to insert content that could create serious problems for node operators

If you are running a full node with Core software especially if it is an archival node your computer will store and process this content automatically without you even knowing what is in it. In many places this could put users at risk depending on what is being stored. Most people running nodes have no idea this is even possible but it is now a very real issue

Some of the developers behind Core have started pushing these changes through without broad agreement. Not all of them but enough that it is causing concern. They are moving fast and ignoring feedback from parts of the community who have tried to raise issues and ask for more discussion. Comments on GitHub are reportedly being removed and those who have spoken out have had their input shut down. Luke Dashjr who maintains Bitcoin Knots has been very vocal about this and has warned for years about what these kinds of changes could do to the future of the network

Bitcoin Knots is an alternative full node software that keeps those important protections in place and does not automatically accept risky policy changes. It is maintained by Luke Dashjr who has a long history of standing up for Bitcoin‚Äôs core principles. Knots is fully compatible with the Bitcoin network and more and more users are starting to run it to protect themselves and the integrity of the system

Running your own Bitcoin Knots node is not just a smart option it is becoming necessary. This is how you take back control. When you run your own node you choose what rules you follow. Developers do not run Bitcoin users do. If you keep running Core without understanding these changes you are agreeing to them whether you meant to or not

Bitcoin Knots now makes up around 20 percent of reachable nodes which is a strong signal that people are pushing back. But we need more

If this change is allowed to move forward without resistance here is what happens next. The blockchain becomes overloaded with junk data. Storage and bandwidth requirements increase dramatically. Governments may begin to see Bitcoin as a liability. Fewer people will be able to run full nodes. Developers who care about Bitcoin‚Äôs principles may leave. Decentralization weakens. The network risks becoming legally questionable or even unusable in some regions. This is not fear mongering this is the path we are on if users do nothing

If you care about Bitcoin staying fast secure and focused on being a monetary network then you need to run Bitcoin Knots. Protect yourself from unknowingly storing problematic data and help keep the chain clean. We are at a turning point. Do not sit on the sidelines

Now is the time to take a stand by running your own node. Let the software you choose reflect what you believe in. Bitcoin only works because users enforce the rules. What you run today decides what Bitcoin becomes tomorrow

Bitcoin Is Being Poisoned From Within.,"this whole conversation is _extremely_ stupid. the filters in bitcoin knots do not work. they delay your non-mining node from acknowledging the existence of a perfectly valid transaction for maybe 10 minutes, until someone mines it, then your knots node processes it anyway. knots isn't preventing anything, and the prior data carrier limit value in core didn't work either.

if anyone tells a valid transaction to a miner, even if your personal node tries to drop it, the miner can confirm it and collect a fee. it became completely normalized to ask miners out of band to perform somersaults after blocks became saturated in 2017. miners like to get paid. it doesn't affect anything if your knots node pretends a pending transaction doesn't exist.

consensus has always allowed big OP_RETURN values. the limit in consensus was never 80 bytes. the 80 byte limit was a soft filter in core that everyone figured out could be easily bypassed. consensus also allows [STAMPS](https://docs.openstamp.io/introduction/btc-stamps) which don't use OP_RETURN or witness data at all. knots doesn't prevent STAMPS from propagating or getting included in a block and they are unprunable. the only thing that can change consensus is a real fork. the knots people refuse to advocate for any fork, unless it's for something brain damaged like decreasing the blocksize to 300kb.

knots is maintained by a mentally ill crazy person who has lost 200 bitcoins, had his dev keys leaked, and doxxed an entire conference full of people to law enforcement. his fork has diverged significantly from core and he is the only maintainer. no serious economic node runner is ever going to depend on this stupid crap for their business critical operations. that would be suicide.",True,3,‚ö†Ô∏è Alert ‚ö†Ô∏è

To make a really shitty analogy, the supply of Beanie Babies wasn't infinite, unlike fiat, which is. The BB had a finite supply and its supply was constrained by factory output and the business decisions of the company. Some designs were discontinued etc.


People believed that they were scarce and rare, and some actually were. But the second everyone decided overpaying for soft toys was a bad idea, the price collapsed. Of course Beanie Babies were never promised as a unit of currency, but I would live in that world for a week just for the story.


Scarcity isn't always and necessarily the silver bullet. Puns, lovely.


Of course, finite resources are probably better than infinite resources from a wealth preservation perspective, but let's not oversimplify it too much.

The reality is it is good, so good that every miner is going to do it, and Bitcoin difficulty will increase every time someone tries to get a piece of the pie. That profit margin will creep down to a marginal return slightly above operating expenses.

bitcoin just broke its september curse for the third year straight,"september has historically been bitcoin's worst month. the numbers don't lie - it averaged -3.77% returns over 12 years from 2013. but we've now had three consecutive positive septembers, including 2024's best september ever at +7.29%.

why september was always brutal

the pattern started during the ico boom in 2017. china banned icos on september 4th, south korea followed on september 29th. that triggered six consecutive red septembers from 2017-2022.

here's what made each september terrible:

2017: china's ico ban triggered the first crypto winter
2018: goldman sachs ""fake news"" about abandoning crypto desk plans. btc had already dropped from $20k to under $7k
2019: bakkt's bitcoin futures launched to weak volumes and disappointing institutional interest
2020: capital rotated into eth during defi summer 
2021: china banned crypto mining and trading entirely
2022: terra/luna collapse aftermath plus fed raised rates 0.75% (the fifth hike that year)

 what changed in 2023-2024

the streak finally broke in 2023 when a federal court ruled the sec's rejection of grayscale's btc etf was ""arbitrary and capricious."" that ruling happened august 29th and carried momentum into september.

2024 was even better. we had:

spot bitcoin etfs already approved and trading billions daily

fed cut rates for the first time since march 2020 (september 18th)

trump's world liberty financial launch got crypto into election narratives

2025 setup looks different

this september we're going in with:
- established etf infrastructure pulling in institutional money
- companies adding btc to treasury strategies 
- rumors about china potentially allowing offshore yuan stablecoins
- fed chair powell's dovish jackson hole speech hinting at more rate cuts
- fomc meeting september 16-17 where another cut is widely expected

 historical context

september being weak isn't just a bitcoin thing. it's historically the worst month for the s&p 500 too. investors return from summer with risk-off attitudes and funds rebalance for q4.

but the pattern often reverses in october. bitcoin has posted gains in six consecutive octobers with only two losses in its entire history.

 my take

the regulatory environment that created the september curse is largely gone. china already did their worst damage. the us has clarity with etfs approved. rate cuts instead of hikes.

we've broken the psychological barrier three years running now. the question is whether institutional flows and macro conditions can keep this momentum going or if we revert to the historical pattern.

with all this potential volatility and the increasing complexity of bitcoin investing (etfs, corporate treasuries, derivatives), keeping track of everything for tax purposes is becoming more important than ever. i've been using awaken.tax to stay organized since the irs is definitely paying attention to crypto gains, especially with institutional adoption making bitcoin more mainstream.

key things to watch:
fed meeting september 16-17
etf flows throughout the month  
any regulatory surprises from other jurisdictions

BCH to BTC Ratio Soars as Supply Squeeze and ETF Hype Build,"The BCH to BTC ratio has reached its highest point in over nine months, a level not seen since early December 2024. This increase comes as balances on Western exchanges have hit multi-year lows.



Daily buyers have been purchasing and withdrawing coins to self-custody, leading to a supply squeeze. As a result, there are few coins available for sale without a significant increase in the market price.



This is happening right before the SEC is expected to release new crypto ETF guidelines. These new rules will likely allow companies to apply for multiple ETFs at once, which could reduce costs, uncertainty, and approval times. This could lead to a price boost for cryptocurrencies, including BCH, at several key stages:



When the guidelines are released.



When companies apply for BCH ETFs.



When the ETFs are approved and listed.



When options are added to the ETFs.



Once a BCH ETF is listed, the increased demand from investors could further tighten the supply of available coins.

  


In anticipation of these changes, Grayscale has been consistently filing for new ETFs, even for coins with a much lower market capitalization, like Polkadot, which was recently ranked 25th. Grayscale is likely waiting for the new SEC guidelines to convert its existing funds into ETFs. For assets like Polkadot, for which they do not currently have a fund, they are filing for new ETFs directly rather than creating new closed-end funds like their other products. Meanwhile, BCH is currently ranked 15th and, until recently, was Grayscale's top single-asset crypto fund.

"japanese company just got shareholder approval to raise $3.7 billion for bitcoin. their goal: 210,000 btc by 2027.","tl;dr: Metaplanet just got shareholder approval to raise $3.7B to buy 210k BTC (1% of supply) by 2027. They‚Äôre building a corporate bitcoin accumulation machine.

metaplanet shareholders just voted to completely overhaul their capital structure, clearing the path for what might be the largest corporate bitcoin accumulation play we've ever seen.

the numbers are absolutely staggering:

 $3.7 billion fundraising target
 goal of 210,000 btc by end of 2027
 currently hold 20,000 btc (6th largest corporate treasury)
 just bought another 1,009 btc on monday for $112 million

to put this in perspective: 210,000 btc represents 1% of bitcoin's total supply. one japanese company is trying to corner 1% of all bitcoin that will ever exist.

the financial engineering is brilliant:

they created a dual-class preferred stock system:
 class a shares: fixed dividends for income investors
 class b shares: convertible to common stock for upside exposure

this lets them raise massive capital while protecting existing shareholders from dilution. it's basically a ""defensive mechanism"" that unlocks billions in funding without destroying shareholder value.

they're building a bitcoin acquisition machine:

metaplanet expanded authorized shares to 2.7 billion shares. that's the infrastructure to raise serious institutional money specifically for bitcoin accumulation.

the board already approved international offerings. now it's just about filing with regulators and finding investors willing to bet $3.7 billion on bitcoin.

the timing is perfect:

while their stock is down 54% from june highs (trading at $5.74), that might actually help with the fundraise. investors can get exposure to their bitcoin strategy at a discount.

plus they're already proving the model works - they're the 6th largest corporate bitcoin holder and actively adding to their position.

the accounting complexity is insane:
systematically buying 210,000 btc over three years creates massive reporting requirements. these corporate treasuries will need sophisticated tracking systems - tools like awaken.tax become essential when you're managing billions in crypto transactions across multiple jurisdictions with different tax treatments.

this is institutional fomo at scale:

when a japanese public company gets shareholder approval to raise $3.7 billion specifically to buy bitcoin, that's not speculation anymore. that's institutional conviction.

they're not buying bitcoin as a small treasury allocation. they're rebuilding their entire business around bitcoin accumulation.

the supply shock implications:

if metaplanet hits their 210,000 btc target by 2027:
 that's 1% of total bitcoin supply off the market
 microstrategy holds ~632k btc (3% of supply)
 combined with other corporate treasuries, we're looking at 5%+ of bitcoin permanently locked up

The precedent this sets

metaplanet is showing other corporations exactly how to structure a massive bitcoin acquisition play:
 get shareholder approval 
 create dual-class shares to prevent dilution
 raise billions through international offerings
 systematically accumulate bitcoin over multi-year timeline

expect other companies to copy this playbook.

my take: this changes everything

$3.7 billion earmarked specifically for bitcoin purchases. 210,000 btc target. systematic accumulation over 3 years.

this isn't some ceo buying bitcoin with spare cash. this is a complete corporate transformation into a bitcoin accumulation vehicle with billions in funding.

if they pull this off, metaplanet becomes one of the largest bitcoin holders on the planet. and they're showing every other corporation how to do it.

what do you think? is this the template for how corporate bitcoin adoption scales to the next level?

"Block Point (BPTS) can incentivize using Bitcoin Cash, even if the coins being used aren't ""yours"".","There are a number of established contracts on Bitcoin Cash holding sometimes significant amounts of capital, but where anyone may create a transaction that moves that capital, for a few hundred satoshis. These are cauldron threads, FBCH threads, and WBCH to name a few; the contracts don't restrict the total number or shape of transaction inputs, they instead restrict outputs on a per input basis.

There's also, a CashToken on Bitcoin Cash [called ""Block Points""](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/block-points-airdrop-token/1554) where anyone may take tokens from a vault, provided they happen to be moving some ""aged"" capital in the first input of the transaction.

So... what does this mean? Well. It should be possible, if there were a 1 BCH output in the [WBCH contract](https://wrapped.cash/) that was a week old, for ANYONE to be able to move that thread, and claim about 1000 BPTS in the same transaction.

    WBCH vault       -> WBCH vault
    BlockPoint Vault -> BlockPoint Vault
                     -> 1000 BPTS ""profit""

So with Block Points, not only do users not have to encumber coins in a Vault to redeem a yield (they can use coins that have been sitting in a wallet). But they can use coins encumbered by vault, even of those coins aren't ""theirs"".

The tokenmoics of Block Points are similar to Badgers, in that, each 20 sats in the per token price equates to about 1% APY.

So if a party claiming Block Points from anyone can spend contracts amassed a million BPTS, and they felt a 1% APY was a fair yield for doing so, they might list those 1M BPTS on tapswap. And any party that saw a 1% APY as a fair market yield might buy them for roughly 20M sats.",False,4,
