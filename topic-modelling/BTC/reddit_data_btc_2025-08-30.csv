$684 a Day with Zero Hard Work,"This is a story about how I quit my job. I worked as a waiter in a fairly expensive restaurant. There was a regular customer whom I always served. He always left me good tips. Sometimes we talked. He asked me how I was doing, and I responded in a friendly manner. I understood that it wasn't entirely appropriate, but we became very close. One day, he showed me his method of making money on Reddit, shared it on his u/eleitl page, and advised me to do the same. I did so without hesitation, tried it that same evening, and it really worked. Now I make about $300 a day and enjoy life.",False,8,üíµ Adoption

"With Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, you can have it both ways (for some time)","If you believe that a new form of money first needs adoption and use before it becomes a store of value, then you should get some BCH and use it.

If you believe a new money can be a better store of value before being hoovered up by the ultra-rich and taken out of general circulation, but then somehow it can surpass this filter and _still_ become a widely used medium of exchange while retaining the benefits of original Bitcoin:

- practical self-custodianship (""be your own bank"", fully control your own wealth)
- permissionlessness
- low friction to transact, in all respects
- competitive transaction fees
- high (best?) network reliabity
- ability to defend the accruing value of the network through Proof of Work (with increasing difficulty of generating new coins)
- decentralized algorithm to achieve consensus (i.e. mining doesn't collapse to utterly centralized state)
- open protocol and open source development to avoid capture

Then IMO you should consider to also acquire some BTC (and hold it or use it).

If you are not sure about which comes first, the medium of exchange or the store of value, or if indeed they might both grow side by side, then you can acquire _both_ BCH and BTC and use them as you see fit. You can even stabilize (hedge) the fiat value of some of your BCH through [on-chain hedging contracts](https://bchbull.com), if the price charts give you anxiety.

This way, you can have the best of both worlds for a time, until one of them becomes dominant as a medium of exchange, at which time you can live the ""Neo"" meme where you don't have to sell your bitcoins for them to be usable as money.

All the above is, to be sure, my own opinion.

I am just presenting it because very often, maximalists will not even introduce you to the possibility that you can use more than one system at a time.

And if you are thinking along, then this means that Bitcoin (and Bitcoin Cash) is also under pressure from other cryptocurrencies and even things like future CBDCs, and the outcome of the whole thing is still uncertain.

But, and again this is my opinion: It makes a difference if a large number of people apply themselves to pursue an outcome that benefits their economic future.",False,0,‚å® Discussion

Bitcoin & Inheritance (safely leaving behind BTC to family),Best answer is education. Get all of your family their own wallets. Even if they only have $10 in it that's enough for them to get familiar with it. When the kids are old enough show them how to make their own private keys and how to keep them safe. Encourage them to buy it themselves and go through the process of selling it. Zero reason for them to know about the inheritance.

There is barely any retail interest this time around.,"ETFS now total 1.6 million bitcoins across 14 countries. Now, add to this all the public and private companies, gov and the like, we are up to 3.7 million bitcoin that is now in the hands of institutions, up 1.5% over last month, and of course these institutions trade during work hours and almost always OTC.

This means just under 20% of current btc supply is now institutional, if you don't account for lost coins and other stuff like satoshis coins.

I have observed that btc price fluctuates mostly during US trading hours and exchange trading volumes are now what they used to be.

Binance has less than 2b of trading volume, this is lower than what it used to be in 2020.

People keep asking about alt season, but the reality is, there is not much retail money flowing into exchanges like it has in the past and your big institutions are not buying your peepeepoopoo coin.

I personally think there will never be an alt season, there is not a lot of retail money, and stuff like pumpfun has absolutely destroyed the trust people have with quick pump and dumps. Combine this with celebs draining little money retail has.

dutch company just raised $23m to buy 1% of bitcoin's entire supply. this is actually insane.,"**tl;dr:** dutch firm just raised $23m to start buying bitcoin, aiming for **1% of total supply (210k btc)**. microstrategy already holds 3%, metaplanet & others raising billions. supply is vanishing, institutions are hoarding, and retail still doesn‚Äôt get it

so apparently some dutch crypto firm called amdax just secured $23 million to launch a bitcoin treasury company on amsterdam's euronext stock exchange. their goal? accumulate 1% of all bitcoin that will ever exist.

let me put that in perspective for you: 210,000 btc. worth over $23 billion at current prices.

and this is just one company. from the netherlands. with $23m in initial funding.

the treasury race is getting absolutely wild

here's what's actually happening while everyone's worried about short-term price action:

microstrategy (now ""strategy"") holds 632,457 btc ($69.5 billion)

japanese metaplanet just approved plans to raise $880m for bitcoin purchases

french semiconductor company sequans filed for $200m equity offering this week

tesla, mercadolibre, kulr tech, and a dozen others quietly stacking

we're literally watching the institutional accumulation phase play out in real time, and most retail still doesn't get what's happening.

here's the math that should terrify bears

if amdax hits their 1% target, that's 210,000 btc off the market. permanently.

strategy already took 3% (632,457 btc) off the market.

add in all the other corporate treasuries, plus the btc that's lost forever, plus long-term hodlers who never sell...

how much liquid bitcoin is actually left?

this isn't some moonboy hopium. this is basic supply and demand economics. companies with billions in funding are competing to accumulate a finite asset, and they're not buying it to trade - they're buying it to hold.

the network effect is starting

what started with one crazy ceo (saylor) has become a legitimate corporate strategy. every company that announces a bitcoin treasury validates the model for the next one.

and here's the kicker - we're still early in this trend. most major corporations haven't even considered bitcoin treasury strategies yet.

this changes everything

when you've got companies raising hundreds of millions specifically to buy bitcoin, and their explicit goal is to never sell, the supply dynamics get completely broken.

retail panics over 5% daily moves while institutions are literally trying to corner the market over 5-10 year timeframes.

the question isn't whether bitcoin goes up - it's whether there will be any left to buy when everyone finally figures this out.

all these corporate bitcoin treasuries are creating a massive compliance infrastructure behind the scenes. when you're holding hundreds of millions in btc across multiple jurisdictions like amdax will be, the tax and regulatory reporting gets incredibly complex. companies like awaken.tax are seeing demand explode from corporate clients trying to navigate treasury accounting standards, international tax treaties, and regulatory requirements across different countries.

thoughts? am i missing something here, or are we watching the great bitcoin accumulation happen right in front of us?",False,344,üì∞ News

dutch company just raised $23m to buy 1% of bitcoin's entire supply. this is actually insane.,"Asset management institutions are regulated, have fiduciary responsibilities, and have internal risk and liquidity mandates. Something is only really worth what someone else will pay for it. This narrative only makes sense if the thought process is that the USD-Bitcoin pair essentially only goes up over time, which has little fundamentally backing that argument (also keep in mind the disclosure that past results do not guarantee future returns). All it takes is a larger-scale liquidity crisis or macroeconomic bear market, and institutions will dump the supply of their riskiest assets first, which would be Bitcoin and really the entire cryptocurrency ""asset class"" entirely.

Just FYI, Bitcoin is fundamentally analogous to a Ponzi/MLM, one day the rug will be pulled as entities profit-take. Whales have been bidding it up for the last 15+ years, supported by the macroeconomic environment of lowest interest rates, money printing, the AI bubble, etc. One day this game of musical chairs will end, and who will be the suckers holding the bag? Do not think that Market Cap/unrealized gains is the same as guaranteed total exit liquidity/actualized gains.

Edit - I'm going to detail why Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are like Ponzis/MLMs:

1)  Reliance on new participants - in both Ponzi schemes and MLMs, existing participants benefit only if new participants join and bring in money/exit liquidity. Bitcoin‚Äôs price appreciation also depends heavily on new demand coming in (since supply is fixed and disinflationary). Early adopters benefit disproportionately compared to latecomers.

2)  Narrative-driven value: Ponzis rely on a story that convinces people they‚Äôre investing in something real, when in fact they‚Äôre just funding the exit liquidity of earlier participants. Bitcoin relies on the narrative of being ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù ‚Äúinflation hedge,‚Äù or ‚Äúfuture money.‚Äù Besides criminal use cases or valuation as a collectors item, Bitcoin has no ""intrinsic value"". 

3) Exponential recruitment pressure: MLMs require constant recruitment to sustain returns at the top. Bitcoin advocates constantly encourage new buyers (‚Äúnumber go up,‚Äù ‚ÄúFOMO‚Äù) which echoes MLM-style enthusiasm.",True,11,üì∞ News

Their goal is very simple. Refuse to implement any L2, in order to drive all transactions on to the L1 chain.

They know that the chain can't scale, but they like driving transactions there because it increases transactions fees and this is good for miners. If the fees become too high, they can increase the block size but that's also good for big miners because it means that only big miners can run nodes.

For eight years non-stop, these big miners have been trying this truly pathetic scam. But they always fail. Nowadays, 99.9% of BTC folks aren't even aware of their existence; the BCH world is like the flat earth community.

q4 bitcoin outlook: are we frontrunning september weakness?,"been digging into some research from network economist timothy peterson and thought it was worth sharing here. the numbers for bitcoin going into q4 are more interesting than they look on the surface.

historically from late august through christmas btc has been positive about 70 percent of the time with an average gain of 44 percent. not bad odds. but what caught my eye isn‚Äôt just the upside it‚Äôs the pattern.

the september curse. bitcoin has never closed september more than 8 percent higher. ever. it‚Äôs usually the weakest month on record. the dip we‚Äôre seeing now could just be that seasonality showing up early. some traders are saying we‚Äôre frontrunning the usual september chop.

why this year feels different. peterson filtered out the weird years 2017 bubble peak 2018 crash 2020 covid chaos 2022 ftx collapse. what‚Äôs left points to a q4 that‚Äôs positive but less wild. that lines up we‚Äôre not in euphoria but we‚Äôre not in crisis either.

also worth watching. bitcoin‚Äôs been shadowing gold with a lag lately. gold‚Äôs been strong and if that correlation keeps up it‚Äôs another tailwind for btc.

my take. the current drop back to july levels doesn‚Äôt look scary. if anything it‚Äôs a setup for a healthier q4 push rather than some parabolic moon run.

if we do get that typical q4 rally, a lot of people are going to get caught off guard by the tax implications. moving from july lows to potential year-end highs creates massive taxable events if you're trading the swings. platforms like awaken.tax have been seeing more bitcoin traders scramble to understand their liability after missing the complexity of timing these seasonal moves.

In this essay I use the perspective and intention of Szabonian deconstruction, as well as our insights from doing the same with Mises Regression theorem, to highlight Saifedean Ammous‚Äô nefarious use and wrapping of academic scholars work notably including Mises, Hayek, and Nash as well as implicitly Szabo and Satoshi.  
  
Further I highlight that Saifedean's account of how money originated and how moneyness originates in objects is based on an anthropologically inconsistent argument with reference to Jo Walton, ‚ÄúThe analogy between Bitcoin and Yapese stone money is based on proposed commonalities that are inaccurate, ill-defined, and/or trivial.‚Äú

Best thing is to buy btc and hold because with buying you are forced to think that yours 5k/10k mining rig will give you btc forever.
You will be lucky getting what you spent,super lucky if you return even the electricity bill,if you buy a miner you should understand that you will have to sell it in few months and buying another better forever.

     Bitcoin on its face value is whatever it is, $115,000 give or take. That gives bitcoin a perceived market cap in the trillions of dollars. 
   However, there isn‚Äôt that much actual economic monies in that market cap. It‚Äôs probably in the billions. 
   Cashing out early movers of bitcoin is taking that perceived value, and converting it into real fiat currency. Aka if you bought 10 bitcoin for $10,000 back in 2014 and now you have $1,150,000.00 institutional companies can now create out of thin air $1,140,000 and take that in under assets.

Bitcoin is not designed for fees to go to second layer networks. The Bitcoin protocol was changes to enable that outcome, and BTC is the result. Bitcoin the idea in the white paper and BTC are competing ideas, and not the same thing. 

In a real economy, Bitcoin whales, with lots of Bitcoin, don't accumulate more without providing value in the economy. So bitcoin holdings go down when you spend, those who earn bitcoin and have bitcoin holdings that increase are exchanging value for bitcoin. (aka providing wealth to the economy)

september could be the reset bitcoin traders needed,"looking ahead to september, i think bitcoin‚Äôs market structure is finally stabilizing after months of messy chop. august was dominated by liquidations, forced selling, and macro headlines. but under the surface, the flows are shifting in a healthier way. spot inflows from etfs and direct purchases are still consistent. miner selling pressure has cooled after weeks of being a drag. open interest is reset lower, which takes some of the froth out of the system.

right now btc feels less overextended than it did back in july. we‚Äôre sitting at support levels that have been tested multiple times, and the derivatives curve is starting to look more neutral instead of over-levered. what matters most to me in september is whether the fed sticks to its softer language from jackson hole. a dovish stance tends to spill directly into bitcoin‚Äôs price because liquidity flows toward harder assets when real yields compress.

i‚Äôm not predicting a vertical breakout this month. but i do think bitcoin could finally see more organic accumulation instead of constant whipsaws. september may not deliver fireworks, but even a clean base would be bullish heading into q4. anyone else reading the tape this way?",False,0,ü§î Opinion

The question is whether you believe the ‚Äúexit liquidity‚Äù theory (sell into their demand), or if this is just the start of a much bigger cycle where institutions drive BTC far higher than retail ever could.

Bitcoin now makes up 1.7% of all global money... that's actually insane when you think about it,"Just saw this River analysis and had to share. Bitcoin hit 1.7% of global money supply when we peaked at $2.4T market cap earlier this month. They're counting all major fiat currencies ($112.9T) plus gold and other hard money ($25.1T) in that calculation.

We're sitting around $2.29T now so closer to 1.66%, but still... in 16 years we went from literally nothing to nearly 2% of ALL money on earth. That includes every dollar, euro, yen, pound, plus gold reserves.

The Fed stuff is interesting too\*\*:\*\*  
Powell basically confirmed rate cuts are coming at Jackson Hole on Friday. Bitcoin jumped 2% right after his speech and hit $116,000. CME data shows 75% of investors expect a 25 basis point cut in September.

Here's what gets me though¬†- central banks keep printing more fiat while Bitcoin's supply stays fixed. Every time they fire up the money printer, our slice of the pie gets bigger just by existing. We don't even have to do anything.

Gold and Bitcoin are basically eating the lunch of every fiat currency right now. The purchasing power destruction is real and people are waking up to it.

Pretty wild that something that started as a whitepaper is now competing with currencies that took centuries to establish. Makes you wonder what 5% or 10% looks like if this trend continues.

If you're riding this wave and taking profits along the way, just remember to track everything properly. Tools like awaken.tax become more important as Bitcoin's share of global money keeps growing and the tax implications get more complex.
