CoinBase ceo brian armstrong says bitcoin could hit $1m by 2030... why its pure and utter overestimation?,"so coinbase's ceo just said bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2030. that's roughly 8x from current levels in about 5 years. sounds wild but let me walk through why this might actually happen.

the math behind it:

bitcoin would need to average about 45% annual gains to hit $1m by 2030. historically, btc has averaged way higher returns over multi-year periods, so the percentage isn't impossible.

but here's what would need to happen:

institutional adoption at scale we're already seeing companies like bitmine accumulating massive eth positions. if similar moves happen with bitcoin at the corporate treasury level, that's a lot of supply getting locked up.

government and sovereign adoption countries are starting to add bitcoin to reserves. if major economies follow el salvador's lead, demand could explode while supply stays fixed at 21 million coins.

currency debasement continues with central banks trapped by government debt (keeping rates artificially low), traditional currencies keep losing purchasing power. bitcoin becomes more attractive as digital gold.

why armstrong might be onto something:

coinbase sees institutional demand that retail doesn't

they see the actual money flows happening behind the scenes

their business only works if crypto succeeds, so they're motivated to be realistic

bitcoin's fixed supply becomes more obvious as more people want it

why he might be wrong:

regulatory crackdowns could stunt growth

competing cryptocurrencies could eat bitcoin's market share

technical issues or security problems could derail adoption

economic crashes typically hit risk assets hardest

my take:

$1m sounds nuts until you remember we just went from $15k to $124k in less than 3 years. that's already an 8x move in a shorter timeframe.

the real question isn't whether bitcoin can 8x again - it's whether the stuff that got us here (money printing, institutions buying, currencies getting weaker) keeps happening for another 5 years.

if central banks stay trapped by debt and keep rates low while governments keep spending, armstrong's prediction might actually be conservative.

what this means for coinbase users:

whether you believe the $1m target or not, coinbase is clearly positioning for massive growth. they're building infrastructure assuming crypto gets way bigger than it is today.

are we looking at a bitcoin cycle top in the next 2-3 months?,"glassnode just dropped some analysis that has me thinking about where we are in this cycle. the data is pointing to bitcoin being in a historically late phase right now.

the numbers:

bitcoin went from $15,500 in november 2022 to $124,500 last week - that's a 700% rally. when you compare this timing to previous cycles, we're apparently about 2-3 months away from where past cycle tops occurred.

currently 91% of all bitcoin is in profit and has been above the +1 standard deviation band for 273 days. that's the second longest stretch on record, only behind the 2015-2018 cycle that hit 335 days.

profit taking patterns:

long-term holders (people who held for 155+ days) have been taking profits at levels comparable to previous euphoric phases. this kind of selling pressure typically happens near cycle tops.

rekt capital says if bitcoin follows historical halving cycles, the peak would be mid-september to mid-october 2025. that's literally 1-2 months away.

current price action:

bitcoin got rejected at $114,000 yesterday after bouncing from $112,000 support. if we lose that $110,000-$112,000 zone, analysts are saying we could drop back into the $90,000-$100,000 range pretty quickly.

what this means:

look, nobody knows exactly when tops happen until after they're done. but when you have:

700% gains from cycle lows

91% of supply in profit for 273 days straight

long-term holders selling at euphoric levels

price getting rejected at key resistance

it starts looking like we might be closer to the end than the beginning of this run.

my take:

this doesn't mean bitcoin crashes tomorrow. we could still push higher and extend this cycle. but the risk/reward is definitely shifting. if you've been riding this from the lows, maybe consider taking some profits. if you are taking profits, make sure you're tracking everything properly for tax season. tools like awaken.tax can help you stay on top of the reporting side while you focus on the trading decisions.

the $110,000-$112,000 zone is probably make or break right now. hold that and we might get another push higher. lose it and things could get interesting fast.

BCH halving is shaping up as one of Q3‚Äôs sleeper trades,"Bitcoin Cash is quietly setting up one of the most interesting plays this quarter. After spiking past $600 earlier in August, BCH has cooled into the mid-$500s with the market pullback. For some that looks like weakness - for others, it looks like the kind of entry point halvings are made for.  
  
The event is only weeks away. Block rewards get cut, new supply tightens, and historically these moments have sparked explosive short-term rallies. Technicals still lean bullish (MACD crossover, RSI not overbought, volumes steady), so the structure is there.  
  
What makes it even better is that BCH is one of the few majors with an active incentive to hold right now.

Calls to Action. Thoughts on Ensuring Success of Peer-to-Peer Cash,"Let's define terms

16 years have passed since Genesis block, Bitcoin is ticking in two branches of BTC and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash is a Bitcoin, it's more elegant chain, but has lesser network effect. ASERT and ABLA are important improvements. I consider Segwit and RBF sand in the Bitcoin machine. By p2p cash on this forum I mean the crypto iteration, Bitcoin 2015 and BCH, if you will. By network effect of a given crypto I mean amount of people engage with protocol in various manner, in concentric circles: being aware, talking, having coins, running a business, creating infrastructure of hardware and software

My estimation is that network effect of BTC is much greater that this of DOGE, BCH, XMR, LTC (other biggest open blockchains) and ETH (most decentralized private money, closed in 2022) 

I don't agree that custodianship trend is caused by higher fees on BTC, p2p cash is the problem, so to speak. I think it's due to level of sophistication that is needed to securely manage one's private keys. BIP39 was important step there long ago. But nothing significant happened since. Managing keys with Electon Cash or Selene on BCH is fundamentally the same as doing so on Electrum back in 2015 over unified Bitcoin chain - from operational security standpoint. This is my perspective: while both operating coins and teaching willing people - technical barrier is just too high


User DangerHighVoltage111 (now deleted for some reason) was responding to me in several threads about importance of p2p cash philosophy. And he created a thread with a call to action of not listening to sirens, presumably myself included - and to teach people

My post is a call to action as well:

* **education**: as DangerHighVoltage111 called, I also call for teaching willing people whenever possible, maybe I am simply wrong about severity of key management problem and growth of network effect of BCH would take care of everything

* **uncensorable speech**: there is tremendous unrealized value of uncensorable speech, potential to overlay all content on the Internet with built-in monetization and user-moderated rating system and commentary, serverless, as hashes on chain (BitTorrent seems the best fit) and well-thought UI unwrapping it: allowing users to bootstrap from zero, without DNS-dependence, locally follow and engage in monetization, donate to content providers. Something, that Memo fell short off, extremely unfortunately. I'm calling for smarter people than myself to develop it (meanwhile, I need capital, and hopefully will have extra at some point - to sponsor it)

PoW, low fees, UTXO system and improvements in OP_RETURN make BCH the best posed open blockchain for this

Hopefully, shattering god-awful ad-based data mining Internet of 2025 to pieces. Admittedly, a big ask

* **key management**: I call for capable people to think about jump to BIP39 and standing still since then, maybe software solution exists which could turn crypto p2p cash into a tool that is as easy to manage as physical cash - which is life saving for poorest productive people across the world

I stand for maximizing economic freedom, and I also stand for not being blind about dynamics in the real world. I'm both heavily allocated in BTC and not giving up on BCH for a reason

Did I pay this 5000+ sats fee by myself?,"Might be a stupid question.

Want to do p-2-p but don't want to do something stupid by accident and lose my security deposit on Bisq. Was forced to use an exchange.

I sent BTC from the exchange to a wallet.

An app in Watch-Only mode for that wallet shows ""Transaction Confirmed 2/6""

The amount sent from the exchange is $0.68 higher than the amount displayed as in possession on the watch-only wallet. This loss is just the network fee which I was already warned about. That's fine.

The problem is, before it said ""2/6 confirmations"", it said there was another fee of over 5000 sats, and that, in USD, is over 10% of the amount I had sent. Is that representative of the entire block being mined, so other senders online right now are sharing the burden of that 5000+ sats fee with me, and my share of the burden was only $0.68? Or have I lost 5000 sats from somewhere (the exchange, the receiver's wallet once we reach stage 6/6, something else?)

"Don't become complacent. ""The market"" will not decide to use p2p for you.","There is a dangerous notion going around that ""the market"" is just not ready for p2p cash and you should just lean back and do nothing and wait until ""the market"" or the people are ready. This notion is dangerous and completely misunderstands the nature of Bitcoin as p2p cash. It preys on your natural tendency of inaction.

Let me make a comparison. Everyone immediately understands the freedom that comes with your own car. But driving around in traffic, taking care of your car also involves a LOT of responsibility that you wouldn't have when someone else would do all this for you. That's why people use caps or busses. And yet while using them they still understand the freedom a self owned car brings. 

P2P cash is not a product that just needs a ready market like an Iphone. P2P cash is a freedom that comes with responsibility. We are in the stage where there are cars but no paved roads yet. Driving this care is difficult and the freedom still limited, yet all the responsibilities are there. To get over this hill, p2p cash needs to be taught. People need to understand the freedom that comes when you accept the responsibilities. And the roads need to be paved. 

If we sit back and do nothing, nothing will change. ""The market"" can print as many units as it wants to prop up false prophets that keeps you in the system without freedom forever. They prey on the greed of people to rather be rich than free. If people don't understand the freedom, safety and literal peace that comes with better, sound money, we won't get over that initial hill.

Psychological: For humans, predicting Bitcoin‚Äôs future is impossible. Our knowledge is limited by our own experiences, and we can‚Äôt foresee the actions of other powerful entities. That makes it less of a science and more of a mystery game.

The only way to find out the value of money is to (try and) spend it.,"This obviously relates to Bitcoin as well as traditional money.

But when I did have this thought last night, it wasn't primarily inspired by Bitcoin - it was because I need to purchase some imported equipment for construction, and I was thinking about how much I needed to spend on that, and how the value of my currency related to the value of the products I was going to buy.

And how prices - especially for construction materials - keep going up and up. 

We (society in general) have practically come to accept this inflation as ""normal"". Most people are resigned to thinking they can't do anything about this.

But we can.

Bitcoin came along to help us. To fix money.

And Bitcoin has already improved many peoples' lives (I'll skip those who stupidly gambled away fortunes against constant better advice not to invest more than they can safely lose).

Bottom line:

A Bitcoin that you can't spend on things you need, is useless, and you'll find that out when you need to spend, which we all need to do at some points in life.

Whitepaper also said quite succinctly: ""The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity."" Not coincidentally just like TCP/IP itself, which is a simple protocol that cares about getting a packet from A to B. Layers on top, like HTTP and SSL, do more complex tasks.

The amount of non-technical people blindly following the religion of BCH is... well, not surprising, considering how there's also a massive industry of shitcoins that could only exist with that same blindness.

Robustness. Security. This is what matters, and BTC's protocol is the right kind of ""good enough"" with the massive first mover network effect needed to maintain its security.

Where can I buy bitcoin at the price it's at?,"Other comments have answered why there is no ""actual"" price. But for specific instructions, if you want the best price:

1. You must use a platform that lets you place a limit order on its order book (Coinbase Advanced, Kraken Pro, etc.)

2. You must place a ""buy"" limit order at a specific price. There are usually helper buttons that auto fill the current ""mid market"" price or select 1%, 2%, etc. over that price.

3. Usually you will get a fee discount if you place a ""post only"" limit order. This places your intent to buy on the order book and means you are a **maker**, which Exchanges like because it creates market liquidity. These orders get filled by **takers**, i.e. people who want the order to complete immediately and opt to pay a higher fee.

The big caveat here: if you're a maker, there's no guarantee you get your purchase. E.g. Bitcoin is $115,000 ""mid market"" and you put a post-only buy at $115,000.

"Qubic attack against Monero failed, now they move to target Doge instead","Qubic ran a miner-bribe attack that tried to incentivize Monero miners to mine against the interests of their network. (receiving payment in another token which was pumped to run a price-dumping scheme against XMR).

Qubic aimed to get 51% hashrate and announced that if they did, they were going to mine empty blocks on XMR, disrupting the reliable functioning of the network.

Although Qubic has not stopped mining XMR at this point, and their attack (mostly through FUD on social media) succeeded to damage the XMR price a little, XMR has remained noticeably resilient on the market.

Mining figures indicate that Qubic only seems to have reached about 34% of hashrate instead of > 50%.

After previously suspending Monero deposits, Kraken has re-opened to them, albeit with a crazy high confirmation threshold of 720 Monero blocks (about a day's worth of processing according to Kraken announcement screenshots).

Regarding the future of Bitcoin,"This post was immediately removed from the Bitcoin subreddit which is somewhat ironic, but I'll post here anyway at the risk of being torn to pieces.

I'll preface by saying i consider my self somewhat of a Bitcoin maxi. I run a node and a small miner, but I am fairly new to Bitcoin so forgive me if I'm missing some of the technical information.

I am trying to learn as much as I can about Bitcoin Ideally from both sides and I keep hearing this argument that Bitcoin has been ""captured"" and that it is doomed to never grow to function as a currency, and that ultimately when the mining supply dries up there will be no transaction fees to support mining.

I'd like to believe that if Bitcoin were ever in a place that the block size needed an increase or any other new development in order to grow to meet demand, that most people would vote in favor of these changes. 

Does anyone here truly believe that Bitcoin should never change or have a block size increase? Don't we all agree that Bitcoin should receive the necessary changes to grow with the world? I don't understand the need for BCH when Bitcoin always has the potential to grow to whatever block size or development change is necessary to make it function. Don't we all have a vested interested in seeing it succeed in the future? Am I missing something?

""We can always increase the blocksize"" is what smallblockers have been saying since 2014. We've heard it countless times, but in that timespan, BTC network has been congested several times, on occasion months at a time, with no action upon those ideals.

Then there is the disingenuous, irrational argumentation and goalpost-shifting from smallblockers evidenced during the blocksize wars, and the result is, there is simply no reason to believe that the argument is anything but hypothetical.

Read ""Hijacking Bitcoin"" if you want to know the full scope of this insincerity.

It led to BCH's creation, and since then there is simply no reason to increase the blocksize on BTC. If you want to have a working Bitcoin chain with SHA256 mining, high reliability, low per-transaction fees, and powerful scripting features, there is Bitcoin Cash.",True,24,

Several scenarios are possible as I can see it:

* p2p cash is just not as important as even Satoshi himself was expecting, market will continue current hybrid trend and crypto will only be used as a tool for savings. 21mln limit is the end-all-be-all of Satoshi's invention. Market continues to use centralize solutions for payments even after debt paradigm dies. BTC goes on, BCH slides down

* p2p cash would become much more important in the mid-term, but small blockers would continue to dominate vanguards in BTC. BTC may stall, BCH may gain. In a severe case BCH gain may cause BTC downspiral

* p2p cash would be such of importance that all people engaged with BTC would be convinced, and new vanguard will push small blockers aside. Including possible quick shift if it would be easily observable that BCH started to gain network effect because of p2p cash demand. BTC may gain much more. BCH slides

BTC and BCH are in tug-of-war. And in SHA256, and in code which enables capabilities. Almost all cool stuff on BCH could be backported onto BTC, if vanguard shifts. I hedge my bets accordingly, weighing these scenarios",True,0,

Is August 2025 still a good time to buy Bitcoin before the cycle peak? Opinions wanted,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been researching **Bitcoin market cycles**, which seem to follow the halving events (every \~4 years). The last halving was in April 2024, and historically Bitcoin tends to rally for 12‚Äì18 months after, usually reaching a **cycle peak** before entering a longer bear market.

Some analysts suggest the **peak of this current cycle could happen around October‚ÄìNovember 2025**. That got me thinking:

* Right now, it‚Äôs **August 2025**, and we‚Äôre clearly in the bullish phase.
* If I buy now, theoretically there‚Äôs still room to grow before that potential peak.
* But after the peak, we could be facing a big correction (like in 2014, 2018, and 2022).

So my questions for you:

* Do you think **August 2025 is still a good entry point for BTC**?
* What kind of **exit strategies** do you recommend to avoid getting stuck in the next bear market?
* Is it smarter to do **take-profit gradually before November**, or just keep holding until the next halving in 2028?

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts ‚Äî I know this community has both long-term holders and active traders, so different perspectives would be super helpful.

Thanks in advance ",False,5,

A Better Configuration for Bitcoin Mining With Miner Control Panel,"I actually had an idea when i visited Bitcoin P2Pool V2 project https://github.com/pool2win/p2pool-v2
So its kind of like combining Gupaxx and Awesome Miner, but aimed at Bitcoin with Stratum V2. The concept is a stand-alone control platform that always uses SV2, so miners can control block templates without extra hassle. It bundles a DATUM template manager, an SV2 proxy with job negotiation, P2Pool support, and a Bitcoin full node into one GUI. Setup is simple: during onboarding you pick which backend to connect through SV2, local P2Pool (bundled), the remote P2Pool mesh, or an external SV2-compatible pool. The wizard would walk through node setup, P2Pool config, and backend handshake, then auto-discover ASICs on the LAN, log into their web interfaces with stored username/password, and push configs so they point to the software automatically.

Like Awesome Miner, the GUI would handle miner management in one place, showing hashrate, stale/orphan rates, latency, fee deltas, and accept/reject logs, while letting you group miners and assign different template policies. Like Gupaxx, everything would be bundled including the node, P2Pool, and SV2, so even non-technical operators can run it out of the box. Operators could choose from DATUM presets (max fees, low orphan, censorship-resistant, neutral) or create custom templates with rules for txid pinning, fee floors, package acceptance, or coinbase preferences. Templates could be chained with failover (Template1 ‚Üí Template2 ‚Üí backend default ‚Üí secondary backend), with watchdogs reverting automatically if stale/orphan budgets or mempool sanity checks are breached.

Packaging could be either a stand-alone controller for people with their own node/P2Pool, or a bundled suite ready to run on a mini-PC or node appliance (Umbrel, Start9OS, Linux flatpak). Security would be built-in: TLS for SV2 links, minimal RPC permissions, backup and restore of configs, and log retention controls. By enforcing SV2 and integrating with P2Pool, variance smoothing stays intact while restoring transaction selection to miners, aligning closer to Satoshi‚Äôs ‚Äú1 CPU = 1 vote.‚Äù Pools still validate and pay, but they no longer dictate transaction policy. It would look like the below image.

The film begins in 2008, during a global financial crisis, when Bitcoin emerged as a new kind of money ‚Äî decentralized, borderless, and independent from banks or governments. As Bitcoin grew, so did debates over its direction. By 2017, those debates led to a split into two chains:

retail is shifting from btc to altcoins and it might signal bitcoin buyer exhaustion,"been watching some interesting data this week. retail sentiment toward crypto jumped hard but it's not going into bitcoin anymore. analysts think this could mean btc buyers are getting tired.

the numbers are pretty clear

crypto sentiment index went from 0.23 to 0.91 in just one week according to bitwise's max shannon. that's a massive jump but here's the interesting part - google searches for altcoins and ethereum hit multiyear highs.

this pattern looks similar to what we saw before previous bear markets. people start looking for alternatives after bitcoin runs up, which usually means the btc party might be ending soon.

bitcoin hit some turbulence

btc dropped below $118k on thursday after treasury secretary scott bessent said the government had no plans to buy more bitcoin for the strategic reserve. he walked that back pretty quick though, saying they're still exploring ways to add btc.

fear and greed index dropped from 68 to 59, moving out of greed territory into neutral. still elevated but not euphoric anymore.

what buyer exhaustion actually means

when buying pressure starts decreasing while selling pressure stays the same, you get buyer exhaustion. basically fewer people want to buy at these high prices so capital starts rotating into other assets.

we're seeing this with retail interest shifting toward altcoins and ethereum. classic pattern that often happens after bitcoin makes new highs.

september altcoin season incoming

coinbase institutional's david duong thinks we're setting up for full altcoin season as we approach september. altcoin season means at least 75% of the top 50 altcoins outperform bitcoin over 90 days.

the altcoin season index climbed from 33 to 42 this week but still needs to hit 75 to officially trigger altseason.

micha√´l van de poppe from mn trading thinks altcoins could see 100-150% gains in their first serious run, similar to what ethereum just did.

what this means for traders

if bitcoin buyers are actually exhausted, we might see:

btc consolidation or pullback in the near term

capital rotating into ethereum and altcoins

potential altcoin season starting in september

bitcoin possibly finding support and resuming later

the broader crypto narrative is still intact with things like solana etf decisions coming in october. policy developments remain favorable.

but short term, retail attention shifting away from bitcoin toward alts is usually a sign that btc's current run might need to take a breather.

not saying bitcoin is done, just that the easy money phase might be over for now while altcoins get their turn. for anyone active in this market, it‚Äôs also a good time to keep tax reporting in check platforms like awaken.tax make it a lot easier to stay compliant without slowing down your trading.",False,8,ü§î Opinion

If Goldfinger did have the funds, the best he could do is disrupt BCH operations by mining empty blocks (win but doesn't including any trxs). However, since BTC supports big blocks, any backlog will be quickly relieved if he doesn't have enough peak hashing to sustain winning every block.
