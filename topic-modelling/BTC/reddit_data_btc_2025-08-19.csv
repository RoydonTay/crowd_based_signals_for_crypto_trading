"Qubic attack against Monero failed, now they move to target Doge instead","Qubic ran a miner-bribe attack that tried to incentivize Monero miners to mine against the interests of their network. (receiving payment in another token which was pumped to run a price-dumping scheme against XMR).

Qubic aimed to get 51% hashrate and announced that if they did, they were going to mine empty blocks on XMR, disrupting the reliable functioning of the network.

Although Qubic has not stopped mining XMR at this point, and their attack (mostly through FUD on social media) succeeded to damage the XMR price a little, XMR has remained noticeably resilient on the market.

Mining figures indicate that Qubic only seems to have reached about 34% of hashrate instead of > 50%.

After previously suspending Monero deposits, Kraken has re-opened to them, albeit with a crazy high confirmation threshold of 720 Monero blocks (about a day's worth of processing according to Kraken announcement screenshots).

Regarding the future of Bitcoin,"This post was immediately removed from the Bitcoin subreddit which is somewhat ironic, but I'll post here anyway at the risk of being torn to pieces.

I'll preface by saying i consider my self somewhat of a Bitcoin maxi. I run a node and a small miner, but I am fairly new to Bitcoin so forgive me if I'm missing some of the technical information.

I am trying to learn as much as I can about Bitcoin Ideally from both sides and I keep hearing this argument that Bitcoin has been ""captured"" and that it is doomed to never grow to function as a currency, and that ultimately when the mining supply dries up there will be no transaction fees to support mining.

I'd like to believe that if Bitcoin were ever in a place that the block size needed an increase or any other new development in order to grow to meet demand, that most people would vote in favor of these changes. 

Does anyone here truly believe that Bitcoin should never change or have a block size increase? Don't we all agree that Bitcoin should receive the necessary changes to grow with the world? I don't understand the need for BCH when Bitcoin always has the potential to grow to whatever block size or development change is necessary to make it function.

""We can always increase the blocksize"" is what smallblockers have been saying since 2014. We've heard it countless times, but in that timespan, BTC network has been congested several times, on occasion months at a time, with no action upon those ideals.

Then there is the disingenuous, irrational argumentation and goalpost-shifting from smallblockers evidenced during the blocksize wars, and the result is, there is simply no reason to believe that the argument is anything but hypothetical.

Read ""Hijacking Bitcoin"" if you want to know the full scope of this insincerity.

It led to BCH's creation, and since then there is simply no reason to increase the blocksize on BTC. If you want to have a working Bitcoin chain with SHA256 mining, high reliability, low per-transaction fees, and powerful scripting features, there is Bitcoin Cash.",True,11,

Several scenarios are possible as I can see it:

* p2p cash is just not as important as even Satoshi himself was expecting, market will continue current hybrid trend and crypto will only be used as a tool for savings. 21mln limit is the end-all-be-all of Satoshi's invention. Market continues to use centralize solutions for payments even after debt paradigm dies. BTC goes on, BCH slides down

* p2p cash would become much more important in the mid-term, but small blockers would continue to dominate vanguards in BTC. BTC may stall, BCH may gain. In a severe case BCH gain may cause BTC downspiral

* p2p cash would be such of importance that all people engaged with BTC would be convinced, and new vanguard will push small blockers aside. Including possible quick shift if it would be easily observable that BCH started to gain network effect because of p2p cash demand. BTC may gain much more. BCH slides

BTC and BCH are in tug-of-war. And in SHA256, and in code which enables capabilities. Almost all cool stuff on BCH could be backported onto BTC, if vanguard shifts. I hedge my bets accordingly, weighing these scenarios",True,0,

Is August 2025 still a good time to buy Bitcoin before the cycle peak? Opinions wanted,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been researching **Bitcoin market cycles**, which seem to follow the halving events (every \~4 years). The last halving was in April 2024, and historically Bitcoin tends to rally for 12–18 months after, usually reaching a **cycle peak** before entering a longer bear market.

Some analysts suggest the **peak of this current cycle could happen around October–November 2025**. That got me thinking:

* Right now, it’s **August 2025**, and we’re clearly in the bullish phase.
* If I buy now, theoretically there’s still room to grow before that potential peak.
* But after the peak, we could be facing a big correction (like in 2014, 2018, and 2022).

So my questions for you:

* Do you think **August 2025 is still a good entry point for BTC**?
* What kind of **exit strategies** do you recommend to avoid getting stuck in the next bear market?
* Is it smarter to do **take-profit gradually before November**, or just keep holding until the next halving in 2028?

I’d love to hear your thoughts — I know this community has both long-term holders and active traders, so different perspectives would be super helpful.

* to DCA sell into all time highs around 500 days after the last halving (between now and October). Yes this means now you should be selling, not buying because you should have been completing these steps since 2021

Yes, August 2025 is still reasonable. Historically, Bitcoin still has upside in the months leading into the peak, but volatility increases.

A Better Configuration for Bitcoin Mining With Miner Control Panel,"I actually had an idea when i visited Bitcoin P2Pool V2 project https://github.com/pool2win/p2pool-v2
So its kind of like combining Gupaxx and Awesome Miner, but aimed at Bitcoin with Stratum V2. The concept is a stand-alone control platform that always uses SV2, so miners can control block templates without extra hassle. It bundles a DATUM template manager, an SV2 proxy with job negotiation, P2Pool support, and a Bitcoin full node into one GUI. Setup is simple: during onboarding you pick which backend to connect through SV2, local P2Pool (bundled), the remote P2Pool mesh, or an external SV2-compatible pool. The wizard would walk through node setup, P2Pool config, and backend handshake, then auto-discover ASICs on the LAN, log into their web interfaces with stored username/password, and push configs so they point to the software automatically.

Like Awesome Miner, the GUI would handle miner management in one place, showing hashrate, stale/orphan rates, latency, fee deltas, and accept/reject logs, while letting you group miners and assign different template policies. Like Gupaxx, everything would be bundled including the node, P2Pool, and SV2, so even non-technical operators can run it out of the box. Operators could choose from DATUM presets (max fees, low orphan, censorship-resistant, neutral) or create custom templates with rules for txid pinning, fee floors, package acceptance, or coinbase preferences. Templates could be chained with failover (Template1 → Template2 → backend default → secondary backend), with watchdogs reverting automatically if stale/orphan budgets or mempool sanity checks are breached.

Packaging could be either a stand-alone controller for people with their own node/P2Pool, or a bundled suite ready to run on a mini-PC or node appliance (Umbrel, Start9OS, Linux flatpak). Security would be built-in: TLS for SV2 links, minimal RPC permissions, backup and restore of configs, and log retention controls. By enforcing SV2 and integrating with P2Pool, variance smoothing stays intact while restoring transaction selection to miners, aligning closer to Satoshi’s “1 CPU = 1 vote.” Pools still validate and pay, but they no longer dictate transaction policy. It would look like the below image. The only reason imo miners saw p2pool to complicated and have no predictable income compared to centralized pool where the only thing they needed is a UI for them to work on plug and play. ",False,1,

What type of encryption am I looking at.,"Before I posted this I looked at a couple pgp examples and they had - and _ in the random letters and number block so it doesn’t look like pgp (as far as I can tell)

Please note the block letters and numbers and the 64 character line are in capital letters. I’m quite sure that wouldn’t have been a mistake and forced all upper case. 

I found 3 btc addresses from back in 2013 and they gave a bit of btc in them (.19 btc enough to make me want to get it back). each had a short wallet identifier name. The first one was 1GAME then next line my email addess then below that 1300 random letters and numbers (no spaces or dashes or underscores) after that was a line of 64 random letters and numbers (no spaces or dashes etc). 

I know this is something to do with my old accounts at blockchain.info which has become blockchain.com. It would have possibly been some type of backup thing they asked me to save at blockchain.info back in the day?
I can’t get in by username and password as I lost the passwords long ago and I wasn’t registered in there to simply get a password reset as it doesn’t work that way. I hope someone can help me somehow work out what these random number blocks mean. (Each is 1300 digits).

Bitcoin MVRV Signals Mid-Cycle Setup for Breakout,"Reposted to here based on Bagatell's post in r/BitcoinCash

Thanks to Paytaca for this nice informative intro-level video.

> The Story of Bitcoin Cash follows the journey of a digital currency from its origins in Bitcoin to its own path as peer-to-peer electronic cash.

The film begins in 2008, during a global financial crisis, when Bitcoin emerged as a new kind of money — decentralized, borderless, and independent from banks or governments. As Bitcoin grew, so did debates over its direction. By 2017, those debates led to a split into two chains:

> Bitcoin (BTC) – evolving into a secure reserve asset for large holders and institutions Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – focusing on fast, low-cost transactions for everyday use

> This documentary explores the early days of Bitcoin, the block size debates, the creation of Bitcoin Cash, and how both chains have evolved. It also highlights how Paytaca and the global Bitcoin Cash community are building tools and adoption for peer-to-peer electronic cash.

retail is shifting from btc to altcoins and it might signal bitcoin buyer exhaustion,"been watching some interesting data this week. retail sentiment toward crypto jumped hard but it's not going into bitcoin anymore. analysts think this could mean btc buyers are getting tired.

the numbers are pretty clear

crypto sentiment index went from 0.23 to 0.91 in just one week according to bitwise's max shannon. that's a massive jump but here's the interesting part - google searches for altcoins and ethereum hit multiyear highs.

this pattern looks similar to what we saw before previous bear markets. people start looking for alternatives after bitcoin runs up, which usually means the btc party might be ending soon.

bitcoin hit some turbulence

btc dropped below $118k on thursday after treasury secretary scott bessent said the government had no plans to buy more bitcoin for the strategic reserve. he walked that back pretty quick though, saying they're still exploring ways to add btc.

fear and greed index dropped from 68 to 59, moving out of greed territory into neutral. still elevated but not euphoric anymore.

what buyer exhaustion actually means

when buying pressure starts decreasing while selling pressure stays the same, you get buyer exhaustion. basically fewer people want to buy at these high prices so capital starts rotating into other assets.

we're seeing this with retail interest shifting toward altcoins and ethereum. classic pattern that often happens after bitcoin makes new highs.

september altcoin season incoming

coinbase institutional's david duong thinks we're setting up for full altcoin season as we approach september. altcoin season means at least 75% of the top 50 altcoins outperform bitcoin over 90 days.

the altcoin season index climbed from 33 to 42 this week but still needs to hit 75 to officially trigger altseason.

michaël van de poppe from mn trading thinks altcoins could see 100-150% gains in their first serious run, similar to what ethereum just did.

what this means for traders

if bitcoin buyers are actually exhausted, we might see:

btc consolidation or pullback in the near term

capital rotating into ethereum and altcoins

potential altcoin season starting in september

bitcoin possibly finding support and resuming later

the broader crypto narrative is still intact with things like solana etf decisions coming in october. policy developments remain favorable.

but short term, retail attention shifting away from bitcoin toward alts is usually a sign that btc's current run might need to take a breather.

not saying bitcoin is done, just that the easy money phase might be over for now while altcoins get their turn. for anyone active in this market, it’s also a good time to keep tax reporting in check platforms like awaken.tax make it a lot easier to stay compliant without slowing down your trading.",False,6,🤔 Opinion

"Excerpt on 51% attacks and ""Goldfinger"" attacks from a talk with Donald Wilson at University of Chicago on November 9th 2018.","This is why BCH is the only coin with any incentive to be 51% attacked.  

51% attacking a chain renders it valueless so no one would ever try it on a chain where they expect to gain value from pirating transactions. 

However I would say there is a real incentive for any large traditional entity to 51% attacking BCH into the ground and eat the cost just do it no longer poses a threat to, say, BTC. 

How much that would cost is about as well documented as the centralization of nodes on a non 1MB bitcoin blockchain, if you know what I’m saying…",True,3,
"Excerpt on 51% attacks and ""Goldfinger"" attacks from a talk with Donald Wilson at University of Chicago on November 9th 2018.","Also, 51% percent is just the name to describe the conceptual minimal threshold to run an attack. At 51% you still only have 50/50 coin-toss odds of successfully executing your attack in the next block. Technically, you'd need closer to 85% to *run the tables* long enough to have any sort of meaningful impact.  And that's really expensive.

If Goldfinger did have the funds, the best he could do is disrupt BCH operations by mining empty blocks (win but doesn't including any trxs). However, since BTC supports big blocks, any backlog will be quickly relieved if he doesn't have enough peak hashing to sustain winning every block.

Not only does he incur the cost of the attack, but the opportunity cost of not mining BTC.",True,1,

"bitcoin hits new ATH with 124K, How high are we looking at in 2025?","so we're past the $124k mark and honestly, the numbers i'm seeing for where bitcoin could end up by december are pretty wild. been digging through everything, from big institutions to crypto analysts to trading algorithms, and figured i'd share what the consensus looks like.

Majority of analysts are believeing in somewhat range of 130k-145k range. this is kind of a safe instituitional forecast, but with bitcoin we have seen how wrong the analysts predictions can be in actually good sense.\\

mid-range optimists are throwing around $150k-$170k targets. investing haven's stretched targets go up to $174k-$181k.  the moonshot predictions are getting crazy though. peter brandt is calling $200k. anthony scaramucci thinks $170k is doable.

what's driving this? the institutional money keeps pouring in—blackrock's eth etf alone hit $10 billion. we've got the strategic bitcoin reserve thing happening in washington. the regulatory clarity act is moving through congress. supply shock from the halving. corporate treasuries adding btc.

somewhere between $130k-$160k feels realistic if current momentum holds. the $200k+ calls need everything to go perfect, but honestly? after watching bitcoin hit $124k when most people thought $100k was ambitious, maybe ""impossible"" targets aren't so impossible anymore.

"Like I'm 5: What are crypto ""layers"" and how do they work?","Can someone explain to me like I'm 5 what a Layer 2 in crypto actually is? I keep hearing about things like Arbitrum, Optimism, and the Lightning Network, but I'm lost. Which coins or blockchains even have layers? Are there only Layer 1 and Layer 2 or are there more? How do these layers work and what do they actually do for regular users? And is there any other tech in crypto that works kind of like this whole ""layer"" concept?",False,15,
"Like I'm 5: What are crypto ""layers"" and how do they work?","Layer 1 refers to transactions that happen ""on chain"". That is, as ""natively"" as possible in your cryptocurrency of choice.

In other words, Layer 1 transactions will be forever recorded in the blockchain and will enjoy the full security and reliability of the cryptocurrency's source code and cryptography.

Layer 2 are technologies that build ""on top of"" Layer 1, meaning you can do transactions *outside* of the blockchain, which enables things that may not be possible in the original blockchain, such as transactions with ""sub-satoshi"" units of a Bitcoin (so a Bitcoin could be cut up into further smaller bits than regularly allowed, which might be useful for example for a streaming service payment). Of course, by using Layer 2 technology, it means you are acting ""outside"" of your cryptocurrency, so things can get risky, and you have to trust that third-party code is safe and that the providers of the Layer 2 technology are honest and will not censor or steal your money.

It should be noted that Layer 2 technology is worthwhile, but it should exist to *extend and expand* functionality, not enable basic functionality or be a band-aid fix. Lightning network is interesting technology, but it can't fix BTC's problems: [https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network)

"Like I'm 5: What are crypto ""layers"" and how do they work?","""Layer 2"" adds either additional capabilities or additional throughput that can't be handled on the base (Layer 1) chain.  

Some ""Layer 2"" use the native token of the base chain, and are only a technology built on top.   (Example:   The BTC Lightning Network)   
But some ""Layer 2"" use their own token.   (Example: Arbitrum is built on Ethereum)   So if you transact on Arbitrum, you need to spend ""Arbitrum"" as ""gas"" to pay the transaction fee. 

Not exactly a ""layer 2"" thing, but the weird thing about a lot of the crypto economy, is that ""Ethereum"" isn't often used as the underlying currency to transact.  It's often using stablecoin tokens such as USDT to do the actual transaction, and the the Ethereum, is just used to pay the ""gas"" fee to transact.  

  
BTW, the Lightning Network is a complete joke, and doesn't work half the time.   Bitcoin should be able to easily scale to VisaNet levels without the need for ""Layer 2"", but Bitcoin was sabotaged.

"UTXO-Z: High-Performance UTXO Database for Bitcoin Cash by Fernando Pelliccioni, veteran BCH developer & Knuth node lead","> __Abstract__

> UTXO-Z is a purpose-built database system designed to overcome the performance bottlenecks that prevent Bitcoin Cash from scaling to global payment volumes. As transaction validation requires rapid access to unspent outputs (UTXOs), traditional key-value stores like LevelDB become the primary bottleneck when processing thousands of transactions per second—a requirement for worldwide adoption.

> This paper presents UTXO-Z, which replaces general-purpose databases with a domain-specific architecture optimized for UTXO access patterns. The system employs cache-optimized data structures, value-based segmentation, and generational storage to minimize memory indirection and maximize throughput. By storing complete output data inline and leveraging temporal locality through deferred lookups, UTXO-Z eliminates the performance penalties of pointer-based storage systems.

> Benchmarks demonstrate that UTXO-Z achieves 2.5× higher throughput than LevelDB during blockchain synchronization, processing up to 290,000 inputs and 320,000 outputs per second on a single thread. Under concurrent access, the system reaches 33 million lookups per second for recent outputs (45× faster than LevelDB) and 1.5 million lookups per second for the complete pipeline (2× faster). These performance gains, achieved through careful attention to memory layout and cache efficiency, provide the foundation necessary for Bitcoin Cash to scale as a global payment system serving billions of users.
