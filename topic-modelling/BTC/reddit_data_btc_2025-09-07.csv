BTC tactical outlook,"Double top confirmation on HTF have us at an interesting intersection considering the level of M2 money supply (not to mention matching cycles via global economic states).

Typically BTC price follows with a lag the money supply cycle. Yes there are countless other moments of volatility which can bring value price fluctuations, or coins to move.

Opening a short here with a stop at the DT feels ok, but dangerous. Simply as a triple top is possible, along with a sincere further surge and bullish break higher… however, I’m not tracking signs that it will occur at all.

Target short profit take at 68k, stop loss at 125k perhaps to be better safe than sorry. Should we cross 10k lines at 100/90/80 etc I’ll add on further layers.

They Blocked My Last Post for Telling the Truth About Bitcoin Core Here’s What They Don’t Want You to See. **PLEASE READ**,"r/bitcoin, r/bitcoinbeginners and now r/cryptocurrency have all banned me THEY ARE COMPLICIT IN HIDING THE TRUTH.

This is a follow-up to my earlier post on r/cryptocurrency that’s now been removed exposing the upcoming OP_RETURN changes in Bitcoin Core and the censorship happening in major subs like r/Bitcoin. If you read that, you’ll know why this matters. If not, this post will catch you up and show you just how far the gatekeeping has gone.

In that post, I called out a huge change coming to Bitcoin Core that’s about to blow the OP_RETURN limit from 80 bytes to over 100,000. This isn’t just some tech tweak it means anyone could shove all kinds of junk onto the blockchain, including illegal stuff like CSAM (child sexual abuse material), explicit content, or other toxic data. And every full node you run? It has no choice but to store and serve that garbage forever, whether you like it or not.

I also pointed out that Bitcoin Knots, maintained by Luke Dashjr, fights back against this and lets users keep control over what their node accepts.

Instead of addressing these real concerns, r/Bitcoin banned me and slapped a “propagandist” label on me. That tells you exactly how much they want to silence anyone who doesn’t just blindly agree.

Here is the response from the r/bitcoin moderators,

Hello, You have been banned from participating in r/Bitcoin(https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin) for 28 days because you broke this community's rules. You won't be able to post or comment, but you can still view and subscribe to it.

Note from the moderators:

Stop spamming misinformation in this subreddit. You clearly don't understand how bitcoin works. Kratter does not understand bitcoin on a technical level. He is not a develope, he has never submitted a commit and he just repeats what other people say. He is a propagandist. He's been getting his information about bitcoin core from mechanic, who also is not a developer, who also had never submitted a commit and who is also a propagandist. You fell for propaganda. Running Knots does not prevent spam from getting in the blockchain. 95% of nodes could be Knots and it would not stop spam from getting in the blockchain. You can come back in a few weeks, wipe the egg off your face and see that bitcoin is still here like normal. Now stop spamming this sub with misinformation.

Now since you won’t give me the chance to respond to you on a public forum such as r/bitcoin I am forced to do this here. Here is what I have to say.

1.	⁠“You clearly don’t understand how Bitcoin works.”

This is not an argument. It’s a lazy dismissal used when someone doesn’t want to engage in honest discussion. Bitcoin was designed to be a system where anyone can verify the rules not just those who contribute to the GitHub repo. Saying someone “doesn’t understand Bitcoin” because they’ve never submitted a commit is the exact elitist mindset Bitcoin was built to reject.

You do not need to be a Core developer to understand the implications of putting arbitrary data on a blockchain. You need logic and a grasp of what it means to operate a decentralized, permissionless financial system that persists across borders and jurisdictions.

2. “Kratter and Mechanic are not developers and have never submitted commits, so they don’t understand Bitcoin.”

This is a classic appeal to authority fallacy. Bitcoin is not a dictatorship run solely by Core developers. It’s a network of users, node operators, businesses, and yes, enthusiasts and researchers who critically analyze and discuss the protocol. Understanding Bitcoin deeply does not require commit access. It requires careful study, analysis, and participation.

Matt Kratter and Mechanic have spent years researching, explaining, and engaging with Bitcoin’s technical details and policy debates. They break down complex changes for the community in ways that are accessible but grounded in facts. To label them “propagandists” because they don’t write code is dismissive and closes the door to any critical voices outside your small inner circle.

3. “You fell for propaganda from people who aren’t developers.”

So only developers can criticize the software? Only those with commit access are allowed to point out risks? That’s not how decentralized systems work. Bitcoin is not a devocracy. It’s a network of users who enforce consensus rules by running their own nodes. Everyone running a node is participating in Bitcoin governance, and their opinions especially about what data they’re required to store matter.

Calling dissent “propaganda” is what centralized regimes do when they want to shut down uncomfortable truths.

4. “Running Bitcoin Knots won’t stop spam from entering the blockchain.”

This is a textbook strawman. No one said Knots prevents spam from entering the blockchain by itself. What it does is give users choice over which policies they follow and what their node relays and accepts in the mempool. Knots maintains sane, conservative default settings and refuses to blindly follow every policy update pushed through Core without broad consensus.

That’s not propaganda. That’s how Bitcoin is supposed to work: users choosing which rules to enforce.

When Core begins accepting arbitrarily large data payloads via OP_RETURN, and when it removes the safeguards that kept non-transactional data limited, the entire network is affected. Every full archival node must now store and serve that data. The fact that Bitcoin Knots refuses to default to that behavior is exactly why it exists. It’s not a patch. It’s a protective fork to keep Bitcoin from being misused as a decentralized dumpster for non-monetary content.

5. “This is misinformation.”

What specifically is misinformation? The OP_RETURN limit is being raised. The filtering of non-standard data is being weakened. Developers have discussed and moved forward with this without broad community involvement or explanation to the wider user base. This is all public information, available in GitHub issues and mailing list discussions.

The reason you won’t address the actual facts is because you know they’re correct and you’d rather paint them as “misinformation” to shut down the conversation.

6. “You can come back in a few weeks and see that Bitcoin is fine.”

This is not reassurance. This is willful ignorance. You’re hoping no one notices the damage until it’s irreversible. That’s how critical decisions get slipped through: with silence, censorship, and minimization.

Bitcoin will survive this month. That’s not the point. The point is what happens over time when you allow the blockchain to become a permanent data sink, vulnerable to abuse, legal scrutiny, and bloated infrastructure requirements that exclude everyday users from running full nodes.

You call it “fear-mongering.” But refusing to acknowledge precedent like explicit, illegal content already stored on-chain is not optimism. It’s negligence.

7. Why people are choosing Bitcoin Knots

They’re not choosing Knots because they think it can magically fix Bitcoin. They’re choosing it because it gives them back control. Because it doesn’t silently adopt every policy change from Core. Because it warns users before pushing experimental features that can have permanent consequences.

And most of all: because it listens to the community, not just to the few individuals with commit access.

Knots is now around 20% of reachable nodes. That’s not a fluke. It’s a growing segment of the network pushing back against quiet centralization and decisions being made without transparent, ecosystem-wide discussion.

Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin. The users are.

If you’re banning people for asking difficult questions, suppressing valid warnings, and throwing around ad hominems instead of engaging with the issues, you’re not protecting Bitcoin. You’re gatekeeping it.

On Comparing Bitcoin with Gold,"Both gold and Bitcoin have excellent stock-to-flow in comparison to fiat money. Two good tools for savings, but I choose the digital one

Gold can not be:

* used to host uncensorable speech

* multisigned

* crossing borders as 12 words in one's head

* cheaply verified independent from transaction amount

* settled internationally within an hour

* foundation for proof-or-reserves with an off-chain signed message

* timelocked

Correct multisignature setup make bitcoins completely secure from any form of theft: govt or $5 wrench. Unfortunately, even less popular than self-custody, Bitcoin Cash branch of Bitcoin included

"bitcoin just reclaimed key resistance and analysts are calling for a ""massive move"" - shorts getting liquidated hard","btc touched $112,900 this morning and the technical setup is looking explosive. we're seeing key resistance levels flip to support and short liquidations are piling up.

the liquidation carnage

$14.32 million in btc short positions got liquidated within one hour as price broke back above $112k. shorts are getting absolutely destroyed and there's clear rotation out of bearish positions heading into us jobs data.

key levels everyone's watching

$112k is the critical level - michael van de poppe calling it ""another massive long opportunity"" if we break above. rekt capital says $113k needs to be reclaimed to ""fully confirm the breakout"".

the liquidity zones are sitting at $111,500-$113,000 with more clusters extending to $115k. if we clear these levels, the next move could be violent.

macro catalyst building

us jobs report drops today and traders are expecting it could show labor market weakness. 99.4% probability of 25bp fed rate cut in september according to cme fedwatch.

here's the setup: weak jobs data -rate cut certainty -risk-on rally. ""the us now has more unemployed people than job openings"" - this could force fed's hand.

technical momentum shifting

analyst skew noted ""$100m bought back"" and ""clear rotation out of shorts"". the bid depth held and we're seeing real demand step in above $110k support.

if jobs data comes in weak as expected, we could see the perfect storm of technical breakout + macro catalyst driving the next leg higher.

the bigger picture

this feels like the moment where macro and technicals align. shorts are trapped, institutions are positioned for rate cuts, and we're testing the upper bounds of this consolidation range.

either we break out here and see that ""massive move"" analysts are calling for, or we reject again and test lower support. but with fed policy turning dovish and technical momentum building, the odds favor the bulls.

what's your take? is this the breakout above $112k that sets up the next major rally or just another false break before more chop?",False,0,

Bitcoin Is Being Poisoned From Within.,"I don’t think enough people are paying attention to what’s happening with Bitcoin Core right now and it’s something everyone running a node needs to know about

There’s a big change coming in October that will raise the OP_RETURN data limit from 80 bytes up to 100 thousand bytes or more. If you’re new to Bitcoin, OP_RETURN is the part of a transaction where people can add extra data that is not related to moving bitcoin around. This was always kept very small to prevent the blockchain from being misused and to keep Bitcoin focused on money instead of becoming a permanent storage layer for unrelated content

Now the plan is to remove those limits and get rid of the filters that previously stopped non-standard data from flooding the network. This is serious because it means much larger pieces of arbitrary content can now be added directly to the blockchain. This is permanent and every full node stores this data forever. This is not a theory. In the past, sensitive and highly inappropriate material has been inserted into the blockchain. It was often disguised or encoded but these changes make it much easier for bad actors to insert content that could create serious problems for node operators

If you are running a full node with Core software especially if it is an archival node your computer will store and process this content automatically without you even knowing what is in it. In many places this could put users at risk depending on what is being stored. Most people running nodes have no idea this is even possible but it is now a very real issue

Some of the developers behind Core have started pushing these changes through without broad agreement. Not all of them but enough that it is causing concern. They are moving fast and ignoring feedback from parts of the community who have tried to raise issues and ask for more discussion. Comments on GitHub are reportedly being removed and those who have spoken out have had their input shut down. Luke Dashjr who maintains Bitcoin Knots has been very vocal about this and has warned for years about what these kinds of changes could do to the future of the network

Bitcoin Knots is an alternative full node software that keeps those important protections in place and does not automatically accept risky policy changes. It is maintained by Luke Dashjr who has a long history of standing up for Bitcoin’s core principles. Knots is fully compatible with the Bitcoin network and more and more users are starting to run it to protect themselves and the integrity of the system

Running your own Bitcoin Knots node is not just a smart option it is becoming necessary. This is how you take back control. When you run your own node you choose what rules you follow. Developers do not run Bitcoin users do. If you keep running Core without understanding these changes you are agreeing to them whether you meant to or not

Bitcoin Knots now makes up around 20 percent of reachable nodes which is a strong signal that people are pushing back. But we need more

If this change is allowed to move forward without resistance here is what happens next. The blockchain becomes overloaded with junk data. Storage and bandwidth requirements increase dramatically. Governments may begin to see Bitcoin as a liability. Fewer people will be able to run full nodes. Developers who care about Bitcoin’s principles may leave. Decentralization weakens. The network risks becoming legally questionable or even unusable in some regions. This is not fear mongering this is the path we are on if users do nothing

If you care about Bitcoin staying fast secure and focused on being a monetary network then you need to run Bitcoin Knots. Protect yourself from unknowingly storing problematic data and help keep the chain clean. We are at a turning point. Do not sit on the sidelines

Now is the time to take a stand by running your own node. Let the software you choose reflect what you believe in. Bitcoin only works because users enforce the rules. What you run today decides what Bitcoin becomes tomorrow

Bitcoin Is Being Poisoned From Within.,"this whole conversation is _extremely_ stupid. the filters in bitcoin knots do not work. they delay your non-mining node from acknowledging the existence of a perfectly valid transaction for maybe 10 minutes, until someone mines it, then your knots node processes it anyway. knots isn't preventing anything, and the prior data carrier limit value in core didn't work either.

if anyone tells a valid transaction to a miner, even if your personal node tries to drop it, the miner can confirm it and collect a fee. it became completely normalized to ask miners out of band to perform somersaults after blocks became saturated in 2017. miners like to get paid. it doesn't affect anything if your knots node pretends a pending transaction doesn't exist.

consensus has always allowed big OP_RETURN values. the limit in consensus was never 80 bytes. the 80 byte limit was a soft filter in core that everyone figured out could be easily bypassed. consensus also allows [STAMPS](https://docs.openstamp.io/introduction/btc-stamps) which don't use OP_RETURN or witness data at all. knots doesn't prevent STAMPS from propagating or getting included in a block and they are unprunable. the only thing that can change consensus is a real fork. the knots people refuse to advocate for any fork, unless it's for something brain damaged like decreasing the blocksize to 300kb.

knots is maintained by a mentally ill crazy person who has lost 200 bitcoins, had his dev keys leaked, and doxxed an entire conference full of people to law enforcement. his fork has diverged significantly from core and he is the only maintainer. no serious economic node runner is ever going to depend on this stupid crap for their business critical operations. that would be suicide.",True,18,⚠️ Alert ⚠️

I don't run hardware myself, but I do get payouts through hashmole. It made me wonder: is hosted mining closer to ""big farm centralization"" or is it actually helping decentralize since anyone can tap into it without owning a warehouse of machines?

The Trump boys just yeeted “American Bitcoin” onto Nasdaq and it’s already a circus,"Eric and Don Jr. decided yesterday was the day to turn their little mining toy into a “historic milestone” and slapped American Bitcoin on the Nasdaq under the ticker ABTC.

Opening bell hits → stock dumps 17% in two minutes 😂. Wall Street basically said “nah.”

But wait it yo-yoed back up 74% by the afternoon because apparently degenerates can’t resist a Trump pump.

First it was World Liberty Financial, now ABTC, and next they’re building a Cronos treasury. Like… at this point it’s less “family business” and more crypto cult with daddy issues.

The Trump boys just yeeted “American Bitcoin” onto Nasdaq and it’s already a circus,"Fun Fact, this phenomenon applies to public listed mining companies.

**The BTC trope is don't buy a miner, buy the coins you'll never ROI with the miner and escalating difficulty.** 

US$17,400 buys a Bitmain S23Hyd (well soon) 

it earns US$ 31.26 per day. (580Th/s)  
it runs at 5510W @ 9J/T  
Assuming US$ 0.05 per kWh   
It costs US$ 6.61 to run per day. 

Retuning US$ 24.65 per day profit. 

Projected yearly revenue of US$8,997.25 per year on capital of US$17,400  
That's a **57.1% return** on capital. **Sounds good right?** 

The reality is it is good, so good that every miner is going to do it, and Bitcoin difficulty will increase every time someone tries to get a piece of the pie. That profit margin will creep down to a marginal return slightly above operating expenses.   
Making this trop almost real: **The BTC trope is don't buy a miner, buy the coins you'll never ROI.**

The suckers in an IPO are paying top dollar for new hardware expecting a healthy dividend, only they don't understand the market dynamic, and they end up losing.

Bitcoin retracing toward monthly pivot – waiting for confirmation,"Bitcoin continues to retrace toward the monthly pivot, in line with previous expectations. Encouragingly, price hasn’t been rejected at first contact, but at the same time it hasn’t shown the strength to break through either.

The pivot remains a difficult level to clear without stronger volume support, which is still missing.

This has been the dominant pattern in recent months, aside from occasional bullish spikes often tied to liquidity grabs.

bitcoin just broke its september curse for the third year straight,"september has historically been bitcoin's worst month. the numbers don't lie - it averaged -3.77% returns over 12 years from 2013. but we've now had three consecutive positive septembers, including 2024's best september ever at +7.29%.

why september was always brutal

the pattern started during the ico boom in 2017. china banned icos on september 4th, south korea followed on september 29th. that triggered six consecutive red septembers from 2017-2022.

here's what made each september terrible:

2017: china's ico ban triggered the first crypto winter
2018: goldman sachs ""fake news"" about abandoning crypto desk plans. btc had already dropped from $20k to under $7k
2019: bakkt's bitcoin futures launched to weak volumes and disappointing institutional interest
2020: capital rotated into eth during defi summer 
2021: china banned crypto mining and trading entirely
2022: terra/luna collapse aftermath plus fed raised rates 0.75% (the fifth hike that year)

 what changed in 2023-2024

the streak finally broke in 2023 when a federal court ruled the sec's rejection of grayscale's btc etf was ""arbitrary and capricious."" that ruling happened august 29th and carried momentum into september.

2024 was even better. we had:

spot bitcoin etfs already approved and trading billions daily

fed cut rates for the first time since march 2020 (september 18th)

trump's world liberty financial launch got crypto into election narratives

2025 setup looks different

this september we're going in with:
- established etf infrastructure pulling in institutional money
- companies adding btc to treasury strategies 
- rumors about china potentially allowing offshore yuan stablecoins
- fed chair powell's dovish jackson hole speech hinting at more rate cuts
- fomc meeting september 16-17 where another cut is widely expected

 historical context

september being weak isn't just a bitcoin thing. it's historically the worst month for the s&p 500 too. investors return from summer with risk-off attitudes and funds rebalance for q4.

but the pattern often reverses in october. bitcoin has posted gains in six consecutive octobers with only two losses in its entire history.

 my take

the regulatory environment that created the september curse is largely gone. china already did their worst damage. the us has clarity with etfs approved. rate cuts instead of hikes.

we've broken the psychological barrier three years running now. the question is whether institutional flows and macro conditions can keep this momentum going or if we revert to the historical pattern.

with all this potential volatility and the increasing complexity of bitcoin investing (etfs, corporate treasuries, derivatives), keeping track of everything for tax purposes is becoming more important than ever. i've been using awaken.tax to stay organized since the irs is definitely paying attention to crypto gains, especially with institutional adoption making bitcoin more mainstream.

key things to watch:
fed meeting september 16-17
etf flows throughout the month  
any regulatory surprises from other jurisdictions

So that's better than not getting interest.  Same would apply to bitcoin. Who would pass up risk free interest payments?

But, in order for banks to emerge, there would have to be a market of people who want to borrow bitcoin to use it for some actual economic purpose... which would mean you would need to be able to buy stuff with bitcoin (which you cant) and get paid in bitcoin (which you cant)

The only people who want to borrow bitcoin today are speculators shorting it for dollars, or who are doing some sort of scam and wont repay.  Banks wont emerge if there is no market useful economic purpose for bitcoin.
