bitcoin hit $113k and the fed rate cut setup is looking spicy,"we just touched $113,279 this morning and the charts are starting to make sense again. reclaimed the 20-day sma at $111,500 and broke back above $112k which was key resistance.

here's the interesting part - gold is absolutely ripping to new aths and historically bitcoin follows with about a week delay. if that pattern holds, we might be setting up for another leg up.

michael van de poppe is calling it a long position above $113k on the daily, which makes sense given we held $110k support over the weekend. that higher low formation is textbook bullish continuation.

but ted pillows pointed out something concerning - this rally is mostly perps driven. open interest is up, funding rates are climbing, but coinbase premium is still neutral. means retail isn't really buying spot yet.

the order book shows a thick wall of asks up to $114,500 though. some traders think it's artificial resistance designed to shake out longs before the real move. cw called it a ""high-leverage short position zone"" which could mean squeeze potential.

fed rate cuts next week should be the catalyst everyone's waiting for. material indicators thinks we get a ""return to the highs"" once that macro tailwind kicks in.

what worries me is that flush potential is always there. we could easily see a quick dip to shake out weak hands before the real move up.

$115k shorts are stacked up pretty heavy according to liquidation data. if we break through this resistance zone, could get violent fast.

anyone else think this is the setup before the real breakout?",False,0,⌨ Discussion

bitcoin hit $113k and the fed rate cut setup is looking spicy,"meh… this little price blip may be being fuelled by speculative trading in perpetual futures, rather than by people buying the actual cryptocurrency. That's typical, given BTC has become another old school financial asset.

Eventually speculators exist, and it results in either price going up or down, mitigating volatility.

>what worries me is that flush potential is always there. we could easily see a quick dip to shake out weak hands before the real move up.

Putin’s Guy Just Dropped a $37 TRILLION Crypto Conspiracy Bombshell,"According to Putin’s advisor, the US is secretly planning to shove $37 TRILLION in debt into crypto stablecoins, “devalue it,” and start fresh.

If you're planning to hedge against the collapse of the US dollar, you can hopefully identify the problems with all these stablecoins, and pick something more resilient, whether it's from among traditional asset classes, or from the ""sound money"" crop of decentralized, permissionless and scalable blockchains (very few real contenders there, as I picked those attributes on purpose for maximal protection).",True,23,📰 News

Transparency That Matters.,"The post has a link to a Github gist that lists wallet addresses used by this malware.

https://gist.github.com/jdstaerk/f845fbc1babad2b2c5af93916dd7e9fb

Note that this malware also targets BCH users, trying to steal Bitcoin Cash funds as they transact, and so there are also BCH addresses in the list.

My recommendation is that you hold off downloading or using any BCH __web wallets__ or any BCH fund-handling software that builds on NPM, until further notice from your vendors. Better safe than sorry.

Wallets that are not built using Javascript, like Electron Cash, should not be at risk. Hardware wallet users should scrupulously verify the transaction details on their signing devices before submitting, to check that the destination address corresponds to the one they intended to send to, and hasn't been substituted before the signing request by a compromised site.",True,4,

"long term holders just dumped 241,000 btc worth $26.8b – are we heading under $100k?","cryptoquant data shows that long term holders (6+ months) have sold 241,000 btc in the last 30 days ..that’s around $26.8 billion hitting the market.

analyst maartunn called it one of the largest selloffs since early 2025. no surprise we’re struggling to stay above $110k after topping at $124,500 last month.

institutions are slowing down too. treasury buyers grabbed 134,000 btc in november 2024 but only 3,700 btc this august. even microstrategy has been quieter.

charts are hinting at a possible bear flag with $112k support. if that breaks, the target could be $95,500. but worth noting  this pullback is still shallower than previous cycles. the realized price for mid term holders sits around $87k, which could be a strong floor.

Bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin,"Bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin. Bitcoin was created to let anyone, anywhere send and receive money instantly without the parasitic transaction fees that banks charge, it was intended to lower the bar of entry so much that the poorest people could store and send money anywhere, anytime. 

Many of the worlds people lack financial services as they don't have any of the paperwork needed for a bank account and are crippled daily by inflation. With bitcoin they were able to save and send a borderless currency, which is deflationary, without gatekeepers or governments stepping in and stopping them. 

Banks and governments were not happy with this, so they lobbied and paid off most of the maintainers of bitcoin's (BTC) around 2015, the narrative suddenly changed around that time from banking the unbanked and permission less currency to ""bitcoin is digital gold"" , and the point of bitcoin only is ""getting rich from price going up"". Slowly but surely newcomers were told bitcoin shouldn't be used as money (as the whitepaper describes) but instead is only useful as a store of value at the same time, transaction fees spiked and the network was intentionally crippled to only allow 5 transactions per second, making everyday purchases with bitcoin impossible. 

In late 2017 a large portion of the original maintainers of bitcoin's codebase decided enough was enough and cloned bitcoins blockchain and source code, creating Bitcoin Cash (BCH), bitcoin cash has been continuously upgraded since 2017, meaning it can easily process thousands of transactions per second, so It can provide to all the worlds people as a safe, borderless currency with essentially zero transaction fees.

 Additionally many of the brightest minds who were originally contributing to BTC ended up focusing on BCH, BCH has been improved so much it is able to perform all of the smart contract functionality that Ethereum can, but again with a tiny fraction of the fees that the Ethereum network takes. Essentially bitcoin cash is the blockchain everyone needs but few realize this and only focus only the one thing that matters the least, the price of bitcoin and getting rich from selling to some other poor fool at a higher price than you bought.

I am scared of bitcoin,"The year is 2037.
After years of reckless money printing, global fiat currencies collapse almost simultaneously. The dollar, euro, and yuan are reduced to worthless paper. Nations default on their debts. Banks shut down.

At first, panic erupts: grocery stores can’t price food, governments can’t pay workers, and people line up desperately at ATM machines that no longer dispense cash.

The only currency with global trust is Bitcoin.

But here’s the catch—
	•	Only a tiny fraction of the population actually holds meaningful amounts of Bitcoin.
	•	Many who once dismissed it or “forgot their wallet passwords” are left with nothing.
	•	The majority are instantly impoverished, while a small class of early adopters—called the Bitcoin Lords—become unimaginably wealthy.

Life Under Bitcoin Rule
	1.	Extreme Wealth Divide
	•	Those with Bitcoin own land, energy, and food production.
	•	Everyone else must work for fractions of a satoshi just to survive.
	2.	Power Vacuum
	•	Governments collapse because they can’t tax or control Bitcoin.
	•	Instead, private security forces and “Bitcoin-backed kingdoms” rise.
	•	Cities are controlled by the richest wallets—anonymous digital monarchs who can buy loyalty with instant, untraceable payments.
	3.	Digital Serfdom
	•	Most people don’t own Bitcoin—they rent access to it by working for Bitcoin holders.
	•	Imagine peasants in the Middle Ages, but instead of paying taxes in grain, they pay their lords in satoshis.
	4.	No Escape
	•	Since everything is recorded on the blockchain, wealth is transparent.
	•	If you have nothing, everyone knows. If you have a lot, you’re targeted.
	•	The poor can’t hide, and the rich can’t ever really spend without becoming targets.
	5.	Energy Wars
	•	Bitcoin mining becomes the foundation of power. Control energy, and you control money creation.
	•	Regions with cheap energy (Iceland, Siberia, parts of Africa) become the new global centers of influence.
	•	Wars are fought not for oil—but for hydroelectric dams and solar farms.


The Horror
Bitcoin was once a dream of freedom from fiat corruption, but it mutates into a new tyranny:
	•	A world run not by governments or corporations—but by a handful of anonymous wallet addresses.
	•	If you don’t have Bitcoin, you’re invisible, powerless, and expendable.
	•	Instead of democracy, society is ruled by cryptographic oligarchs—people you never see, who never speak, but whose decisions ripple across the entire planet.",False,6,

An “Enthememetic” and Esoteric Approach For Non-Bitcoin Enthusiasts to Understand Bitcoin,"# A Gentle Introduction

This writing is for casual readers, perhaps even economists or mathematicians, that are confused about what bitcoin is and yet would like to understand what it is, and perhaps also for those that have become more confused after having been explained what bitcoin is by bitcoin enthusiasts.

It won’t go into detail of the computer science involved, nor the mathematics, nor the economics.

We will also traverse an esoteric explanation of the significance and relevance of bitcoin that will affect all of humanity-not just those that have or hold bitcoin and stand to gain direct wealth from it.

Thus for the experts and bitcoin enthusiasts there will be details lacking; for the casual readers confused by the enthusiasts clarity should result from reading this article.

# On the Genesis of Bitcoin

>I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.

>\~Satoshi Nakamoto bitcoin’s pseudonymous inventor [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=48.msg329#msg329](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=48.msg329#msg329)

On October 31, 2008 a pseudonymous account “Satoshi Nakamoto” announced on a cryptography mailing list (think internet group chain letters) announced, “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.” along with posting [a whitepaper explaining his project](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) and then a few months later posted the associated software.

The basic idea was that if you run Satoshi’s software you offer your computing power (paid for by your electricity bill) in exchange for an (probabilistically determined) amount of newly created bitcoins.

These bitcoins could be saved, sent, or sold like digital internet money created from thin air.

# A Brief History of the Success of Bitcoin

In the history of economics there is not really an argument put forth that a money medium, of ANY sort let alone digital, could bootstrap its own value based on scarcity alone. Thus May 22, 2010, Bitcoin Pizza Day, is widely celebrated by “bitcoiners” as a historical event that first publicly provided bitcoin COULD in fact bootstrap simply based on its scarcity and money properties. The event was the transaction of bitcoin for pizzas that answered this forum post request:

>I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!

>I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.

>If you’re interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.

>Thanks, Laszlo\`

Since that day where two pizzas were worth, to Laszlo and his counterparty 10,000 bitcoins, bitcoin has become worth over $100,000 (USD) per bitcoin and has [a market cap of over $2 trillion (US)](https://coinmarketcap.com/).

# Understanding What Bitcoin Is-a Non Fanatical Explanation

>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: transaction management and money issuance are carried out collectively by the network.

>\~https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main\_Page

Thankfully for the casual reader (and perhaps even the economists, computer scientists, or mathematicians not very interested in bitcoin) we are not going to address the above explanation of what bitcoin is. Nor will we explain what the specialized words and phrases mean. We can understand bitcoin much better with a much simpler explanation and overview.

Here is the technical explanation of the security algorithm that governs the creation of new bitcoins (for the casual readers not specialized in computer science you might even skip this quote as we will explain it afterwards anyways):

>To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they’re generated too fast, the difficulty increases.

>\~Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin Whitepaper [https://cdn.nakamotoinstitute.org/docs/bitcoin.pdf](https://cdn.nakamotoinstitute.org/docs/bitcoin.pdf)

Bitcoin is a security CONJECTURE. The simple idea is that the system raises or lowers its security metric in proportion to the computing power available on the network (which could be used to attack it). If the computing power doubles then so does the level of security that guards the network (or if the computing power halves then so does the security). It’s conjectural because there is no mathematical proof associated that proves the proportional security will be sufficient, however, intuitively even the casual reader could agree such a system would be secure-albeit without understanding HOW the system works as such. This security conjecture also governs the supply schedule of newly created bitcoins:

>As computers get faster and the total computing power applied to creating bitcoins increases, the difficulty increases proportionally to keep the total new production constant. Thus, it is known in advance how many new bitcoins will be created every year in the future.

# Bitcoin Maximalism, Hyperbitocoinization, and the Nakamoto Institute

>It’s very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I’m better with code than with words though.

>\~Satoshi Nakamoto [https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/12/](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/12/)

After bitcoin’s inception “Bitcoin Maximalism” was soon born-a philosophy that bitcoin is to replace all other currencies in the world. Bitcoin Maximalists refer to all non-bitcoin money as feces-shitcoins!

Furthermore, bitcoin was quickly adopted by a libertarian faction (think tax evaders!) as well as proponents of Austrian economics (a branch of economics which abhors government mandated money). One such libertarian and proponent of Austrian economics Daniel Krawisz (a [writer for the Mises Institute](https://mises.org/profile/daniel-krawisz%20branch) a school dedicated to one branch of Austrian economics) coined and defined the term “hyperbitcoinization” as an event in which bitcoin supplants all other competing currencies:

>…hyperbitcoinization, which is what would happen to any hapless currency that stands in Bitcoin’s path of total world domination. If this happens, the currency will rapidly lose value as Bitcoin supplants it.

>\~Daniel Krawisz [https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/)

Krawisz and others such as Parker Lewis are bitcoin maximalists are highlighted on the [Nakamoto Institute website](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/) (a site dedicated to the bitcoin maximalist and libertarian perspective of bitcoin-note from the initial quote in this section Satoshi spoke as if NOT himself a libertarian):

>Bitcoin obsoletes all other money because economic systems converge on a single currency, and bitcoin has the most credible monetary properties

>\~ Parker Lewis, Bitcoin Obsoletes All Other Money [https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-obsoletes-all-other-money/](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-obsoletes-all-other-money/)

Parker makes the unfounded claim that economic systems converge on a single currency (something never observed in the history of mankind). We should note for future reference in this writing Parker ends his essay with a citation of Friedrich Hayek whom we will show to be relevant later:

>I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take it violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can’t stop.

>\~F.A. Hayek. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBIidtaUCzs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBIidtaUCzs)

# The Bretton Woods Conference and the Triffin dilemma

The Bretton Woods arrangement of the global economy was the outcome of a conference held near the end of the second world war. The purpose was to design a framework that ensured global economic stability and thus global peace. Its workings was like a neo-gold standard in which the United States would peg the USD exchange rate to a certain ratio of gold and that participating countries would then accept the USD as if it were equivalent to gold.

This system was criticized by a notable economist “Robert Triffin” under a complaint now known as the “Triffin Dilemma” since the role of serving the world with the “reserve currency”, which has associated long term international demand, directly conflicts with the short-term domestic wants of the nation that serves it.

Sure enough in 1971, Triffin was vindicated, and the US massively disrupted the global economy when then US President Nixon announced the Bretton Woods arrangement of pegging the USD to gold would no longer be in effect. This was an event now known as the Nixon shock.

# F A Hayek, the Fatal Conceit, and the Denationalisation of Money

We now jump to understand Hayek’s works and its significance and relevance to the problem of the Triffin Dilemma with respect to the Bretton Woods arrangement and the Nixon shock. Hayek has written extensively on the problem of the central-planning of economies (whether local or global). He calls the attempt to do so the “Fatal Conceit” (here conceit refers to the definition ‘excessive pride in oneself’):

>To understand our civilisation, one must appreciate that the extended order resulted not from human design or intention but spontaneously: it arose from unintentionally conforming to certain traditional and largely moral practices, many of which men tend to dislike, whose significance they usually fail to understand, whose validity they cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly spread by means of an evolutionary selection — the comparative increase of population and wealth — of those groups that happened to follow them.

>\~F A Hayek, The Fatal Conceit

Rather than approaching an economy with the question of how to organize it, especially politically, Hayek explains and warns, that an economy’s function is organization-therefore any exogenous attempt to organize an economy precludes it from performing its own function.

An economy that is not left to self-organize is thus run by totalitarian authority that deprives the participating agents or citizenry of the benefits of the self-organizing function. Hayek saw our world as a perpetual slide towards this authoritarian driven inefficiency and deprivation of natural order and rights:

>It will be necessary that the problem and the urgent need of reform come to be widely understood. The issue is not one which, as may at first appear to the layman, concerns a minor technicality of the financial system ‘which he has never quite understood. It refers to the one way in which we may still hope to stop the continuous progress of all government towards totalitarianism which already appears to many acute observers as inevitable. I wish I could advise that we proceed slowly. But the time may be short.

>\~F A Hayek, The Denationalisation of Money

Notably in contrast the bitcoin maximalist view, the hyperbitcoinization event, and Parker’s (who somehow cites Hayek!) claim that economies tend to converge on a single currency, in his proposal The Denationalisation of Money Hayek calls not for a destruction of the old order but the introduction of competition of currencies:

>What is now urgently required is not the construction of a new system but the prompt removal of all the legal obstacles which have for two thousand years blocked the way for an evolution which is bound to throw up beneficial results which we cannot now foresee.

# Re-evaluating Hollywood Movie A Beautiful Mind

Curiously perhaps we now turn to a hollywood movie that most (western) people of its time have seen “A Beautiful Mind”. The plot is a true story of a famous and highly regarded brilliant mathematician John Nash (played by Russell Crowe) that apparently descended into madness.

Here we are thinking of a scene where Nash, confined in a mental institution, was visited by his wife Alicia. In this scene Nash whispers to his wife (played by Jennifer Connelly), “Alicia I’ve been doing top secret work for the government…”

She promptly cuts him off and places a stack of letters on the table between them and frantically tries to convince him to understand he’s falling victim to mental delusions, “They’ve never been opened. It isn’t real. There is no conspiracy John… It’s in your mind.”

Years later however the NSA declassified [one such set of letters](https://www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/nash-letters/nash_letters1.pdf) of which expert and world renown cryptographers [Ron Rivest and Adi Shamir have said](https://www.iacr.org/conferences/eurocrypt2012/Rump/nash.pdf), “In his letters, Nash anticipated the birth of complexity theory a decade later, and the birth of modern cryptography two decades later.”

These letters alone disprove the plot of the movie and there are many more known correspondences and programs with various US intelligence agencies Nash was involved with that prove him to have been working on significant projects with these institutions.

Truth be told Nash, only in his 20’s at the time, put out multiple groundbreaking academic papers spanning a wide range of fields, of what significance would only be understood decades later and he eventually decided to flee to Europe to exchange his USD for the Swiss because of an insight that we will explain in the proceeding sections.

# John Nash’s Proposal for Ideal Money and Its Parallelity With Hayek’s Denationalisation of Money

>I learned of the work and publications of Friedrich von Hayek. I must say that my thinking is apparently quite parallel to his thinking in relation to money and particularly with regard to the non-typical viewpoint in relation to the functions of the authorities which in recent times have been the sources of currencies (earlier “coinage”).

>\~https://web.math.princeton.edu/jfnj/texts\_and\_graphics/Main.Content/IDEAL\_MONEY.../Older/PENN\_STATE/babu.money.b.pdf

Nash received a nobel prize in 1994 based on [a paper he wrote in 1950](https://library.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf6021/files/documents/Non-Cooperative_Games_Nash.pdf) (he would have been about 22) and immediately thereafter began giving lectures around the world on [his proposal he called Ideal Money](https://web.math.princeton.edu/jfnj/texts_and_graphics/Main.Content/IDEAL_MONEY.../Older/PENN_STATE/babu.money.b.pdf).

In his lectures and writings on the subject Nash defines and uses a device he called the “ICPI” (“industrial consumption price index):

>A possible non-political basis for a value standard which could be used for money would be a good “ICPI” statistic where this acronym refers to “industrial consumption price index”. That could be calculated from the international prices of commodities, such as copper, silver, tungsten, etc. that are used in industrial activities.

>\~John Nash Ideal Money Southern Economic Journal Vol. 69, №1 (Jul., 2002), pp. 4–11 (8 pages) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1061553](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1061553)

The ICPI was to be a globally held basis for a standard of value that all major currencies would peg to. This is similar to the Bretton Woods arrangement or a gold standard but instead of pegging to the USD or to Gold currencies would be pegged to a politically agreed upon basket of commodity prices (for the economists of today reading this writing this is an easy to understand concept because all the centrally banked currencies of today inflation target a LOCALLY chosen and observed basket of prices). This would remove the problem of the Triffin Dilemma from the global financial system.

This device, the ICPI, is the part of Nash’s proposal that most perfectly fits with Hayek’s proposal for “The Denationalisation of Money” where Hayek introduces (to his reader’s imagination) his currency he calls the “Ducat” which is itself like in Nash’s proposal, tied to a chosen basket of globally observed commodity prices (the casual reader is encouraged to trust our comparison and skip this paragraph/quote):

>It might be expedient that the issuing institution should from the outset announce precisely the collection of commodities in terms of which it would aim to keep the value of the ‘ducat’ constant. But it would be neither necessary nor desirable that it tie itself legally to a particular standard. Experience of the response of the public to competing offers would gradually show which combination of commodities constituted the most desired standard at any time and place. Changes in the importance of the commodities, the volume in which they were traded, and the relative stability or sensitivity of their prices (especially the degree to which they were determined competitively or not) might suggest alterations to make the currency more popular. On the whole I would expect that, for reasons to be explained later (Section XIII), a collection of raw material prices, such as has been suggested as the basis of a commodity reserve standard,l would seem most appropriate, both from the point of view of the issuing bank and from that of the effects of the stability of the economic process as a whole.

>\~F A Hayek The Denationalisation of Money

Hayek as the manager of what we could call the “Bank of Hayek” manages his Ducat currency in the same way Nash prescribes central banks should in his proposal:

>I would announce at the same time my intention to regulate the quantity of the ducats so as to keep their (precisely defined) purchasing power as nearly as possible constant. I would also explain to the public that I was fully aware I could hope to keep these ducats in circulation only if I fulfilled the expectation that their real value would be kept approximately constant. And I would announce that I proposed from time to time to state the precise commodity equivalent in terms of which I intended to keep the value of the ducat constant, but that I reserved the right, after announcement, to alter the composition of the commodity standard as \[46\] experience and the revealed preferences of the public suggested.

>\~F A Hayek The Denationalisation of Money

And Hayek reconfirms our claims that such a mechanism and prescription is rather conventional central banking practice:

>This will cease to seem shocking when we remember that this is precisely what practically all central banks have been doing for nearly half a century-their notes were of course redeemable in precisely nothing.

>\~Hayek The Denationalisation of Money

# Nash’s Ideal Proposal as an Enthymeme

>Enthymeme-noun an argument in which one premise is not explicitly stated.

>\~Oxford Languages

Interestingly to note Nash defeats his own basis to his proposal noting that technological advance (such as a dramatic reduction in the cost to produce commodities chosen for the ICPI) would necessitate changes in the composition of the basket of prices politically agreed upon. This reintroduces the problem of political difficulty the ICPI was meant to remove:

>We can see that times could change, especially if a “miracle energy source” were found, and thus if a good ICPI index is constructed it should not be expected to be valid, as initially defined, into all eternity. It would instead be appropriate for it to be regularly readjusted depending on how the patterns of international trade would actually evolve. Here, evidently, politicians in control of the authority behind standards COULD corrupt the continuity of a good standard, but depending on how things were fundamentally arranged, the probabilities of serious damage through “political corruption” might become as small as the probabilities that the values of the standard meter and kilogram will be corrupted through the actions of politicians.

>\~John Nash Ideal Money Southern Economic Journal Vol. 69, №1 (Jul., 2002), pp. 4–11 (8 pages) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1061553](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1061553)

In a subsequent writing Nash furthermore removes the ICPI as a premise for his proposal:

>It seems possible and not unlikely, however, that if two states evolve towards having currencies or more stable value as measured locally by national CPI indices that then also these distinct currencies would tend to evolve towards more stable comparative relations of value.

>Then the limiting or “asymptotic” result of such an evolutionary trend would be in effect “ideal money” but this as a result achieved without the adoption of anything like an ICPI index as a basis for the standard of value.

# The Nashian Orientation of Bitcoin (Which is Also the Hayekian Orientation)

>We can prepare to appropriately respect the functioning of such an agency (conceivably like the IMF or BIS or ECB) and concede to the effective agency some discretion about the specific form of a guiding index of prices.

>\~John NashIdeal Money and the Motivation of Savings and Thrift [https://github.com/jalToorey/IdealMoney/wiki/Ideal-Money-and-the-Motivation-of-Savings-and-Thrift-(Honesty)](https://github.com/jalToorey/IdealMoney/wiki/Ideal-Money-and-the-Motivation-of-Savings-and-Thrift-(Honesty))

Hayek and Nash both argue that if the major centrally banked currencies were put on a stage of competition with a comparatively “good currency” such a scenario would not result in a single currency that supplanted the rest but rather the optimization of all of the major currencies with respect the otherwise superior one:

>The scheme would, to all intents and purposes, amount to a displacement of the national circulations only if the national monetary authorities misbehaved

>\~F A Hayek, *Denationalisation of Money*

Nash notes that the evolution to a higher order of comparatively ideal currencies is not one that can necessarily be politically constructed nor simply decreed out of reason and logic:

>…one cannot logically feel confident of the adoption internationally of an ideal system of currency or currencies in an achievement analogous to the achievement of the metric system or of “the euro”. Such a result would necessarily have a political content since it is the states that control and supply the various currencies that are in use at the present time.

>\~John Nash Asymptotically Ideal Money [https://fermatslibrary.com/p/213f2919](https://fermatslibrary.com/p/213f2919)

However he sees that if there can be some evolution towards “inter-relational stability” then at some point along the timeline of such a future trend there could then be the possibility of a global initiative and political framework to [“let it be done”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money):

>So it occurs to me to think that that which is not achieved by a grand action of establishment by “fiat” may alternatively tend to come into existence as a consequence of a process of evolution. And of course, after a certain degree of progress by “evolution” the rest of the progress could possibly be realized by a convention or a process of “fiat”.

>\~John Nash Asymptotically Ideal Money [https://fermatslibrary.com/p/213f2919](https://fermatslibrary.com/p/213f2919)

These sentiments seem clearly concordant with Hayek’s:

>The purpose of this scheme is to impose upon existing monetary and financial agencies a very much needed discipline by making it impossible for any of them, or for any length of time, to issue a kind of money substantially less reliable and useful than the money of any other

My First Lesson in Crypto Volatility,"One thing every beginner hears about crypto is “it’s volatile.” I didn’t fully understand what that meant until I actually lived it.

In May 2021, just a few months after I bought Bitcoin, the price dropped about **35%** in what felt like the blink of an eye. Then, in October that same year, it bounced back and climbed **40%**. As a recent college grad, those swings felt like a rollercoaster.

That’s when I learned that **volatility = how quickly and dramatically prices move up or down.**

* High volatility → huge swings in price (both ways).
* Low volatility → slow, steady moves.

The lesson for me: volatility cuts both ways. It tests your patience, but it also creates opportunity. With high risk comes the potential for high reward - the same market that can drop fast can also rebound just as quickly.

**TLDR:** Crypto volatility = dramatic price swings. My early experience: -35% in May 2021, +40% in Oct. 2021. Scary at first, but I realized volatility is what makes crypto both risky *and* rewarding.",False,0,

bitcoin mining difficulty just hit another ath at 134.7 trillion what does this actually mean?,"so difficulty just broke records again and is sitting at 134.7 trillion. this is wild because everyone was expecting it to drop after the august highs but nope, it just keeps climbing.

here's the thing that's got me thinking. hashrate is actually down from over 1 trillion to 967 billion hashes per second since early august. so we've got less total mining power but higher difficulty. the network is literally getting more efficient at the worst possible time for miners.

margins are getting absolutely crushed right now. we're talking about an industry that was already running razor thin profits, and now you need even more computing power to mine the same blocks. the small guys are getting squeezed out hard.

but here's what's crazy. three solo miners still managed to hit blocks in july and august. one dude literally made 373k with probably a tiny operation compared to the big players. they were all using solo ck pool which is pretty smart if you ask me.

speaking of mining rewards, the tax implications are getting more complex too. miners now deal with higher difficulty meaning fewer rewards, but when they do hit, tools like awaken.tax become crucial for tracking cost basis on equipment depreciation versus actual mining income. especially with these massive one-off solo mining wins that can push someone into completely different tax brackets overnight.

the centralization concerns are real though. when difficulty keeps going up but margins keep shrinking, only the massive operations with cheap electricity and latest hardware can survive. we're basically watching bitcoin mining turn into a corporate game in real time.

what's your take on this? are we heading toward a future where only a handful of massive mining corps control the network, or will solo miners always find a way to compete? the fact that small players are still hitting blocks gives me some hope but the trend isn't looking great for decentralization.",False,22,⌨ Discussion

bitcoin mining difficulty just hit another ath at 134.7 trillion what does this actually mean?,"Solo miners are still hitting blocks because the interval (10 min) is reasonably small enough to allow the occasional low-hashrate luck miner to get squeezed in every once in awhile. Consider that there are only an average of 144 mined blocks per 24 hours, which means if you think of it like a lottery then you have about 4320 draws per month, where for every 1 ticket of a solo miner you have huge mining farms buying perhaps tens of thousands of tickets. However, there are \*lots\* of solo lottery miners out there. So while the chances of any individual solo miner having the winning ticket is extremely low, the chances of ONE OF the many out there having one is not terrible.

In fact, with your own observation of about 1 solo winner per month, we can make a rough estimate that the combined solo vs farm hashrates are about 1 to 4320.

As for what it will look like in the future, who knows? It sure seems like big farms just keep increasing in number. But the profit margins are starting to get to the low end these days, with a typical ROI at around the 2 year range. The more competition, then the longer that ROI becomes.

However, when the Bitcoin Core developers were pressed to increase the blocksize, it was of course contentious, and the competing sides began sizing up and counting nodes as some form democratic head count for voting. This lead to brigading and folks spun up thousands of rented cloud computing to inflate the ""node"" counts. **That quickly raised the debate of the usefullness of non-mining nodes, aka Full Nodes.**

If I recall, the only justification for running a Full Node was if you had an application that required lots of blockchain data/details, so keeping it close on a local server meant running a Full Node.

There were numerous discussions describing the negative effects of Full Nodes. They're considered a liability to actual Miners and that Mining Nodes would avoid them, namely because Full Nodes were easily spun up en masse and could be used to submit invalid/bad blocks that the Miner would need to validate, leading to a form of DDOS attack.

It was simply best for Mining Nodes to favor other Mining Nodes to minimize threats, prevent orphaned blocks, and minimize any lag to quickly begin mining on the most recently discovered valid block.

They Blocked My Last Post for Telling the Truth About Bitcoin Core Here’s What They Don’t Want You to See. **PLEASE READ**,"r/bitcoin, r/bitcoinbeginners and now r/cryptocurrency have all banned me THEY ARE COMPLICIT IN HIDING THE TRUTH.

This is a follow-up to my earlier post on r/cryptocurrency that’s now been removed exposing the upcoming OP_RETURN changes in Bitcoin Core and the censorship happening in major subs like r/Bitcoin. If you read that, you’ll know why this matters. If not, this post will catch you up and show you just how far the gatekeeping has gone.

In that post, I called out a huge change coming to Bitcoin Core that’s about to blow the OP_RETURN limit from 80 bytes to over 100,000. This isn’t just some tech tweak it means anyone could shove all kinds of junk onto the blockchain, including illegal stuff like CSAM (child sexual abuse material), explicit content, or other toxic data. And every full node you run? It has no choice but to store and serve that garbage forever, whether you like it or not.

I also pointed out that Bitcoin Knots, maintained by Luke Dashjr, fights back against this and lets users keep control over what their node accepts.

Instead of addressing these real concerns, r/Bitcoin banned me and slapped a “propagandist” label on me. That tells you exactly how much they want to silence anyone who doesn’t just blindly agree.

Here is the response from the r/bitcoin moderators,

Hello, You have been banned from participating in r/Bitcoin(https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin) for 28 days because you broke this community's rules. You won't be able to post or comment, but you can still view and subscribe to it.

Note from the moderators:

Stop spamming misinformation in this subreddit. You clearly don't understand how bitcoin works. Kratter does not understand bitcoin on a technical level. He is not a develope, he has never submitted a commit and he just repeats what other people say. He is a propagandist. He's been getting his information about bitcoin core from mechanic, who also is not a developer, who also had never submitted a commit and who is also a propagandist. You fell for propaganda. Running Knots does not prevent spam from getting in the blockchain. 95% of nodes could be Knots and it would not stop spam from getting in the blockchain. You can come back in a few weeks, wipe the egg off your face and see that bitcoin is still here like normal. Now stop spamming this sub with misinformation.

Now since you won’t give me the chance to respond to you on a public forum such as r/bitcoin I am forced to do this here. Here is what I have to say.

1.	⁠“You clearly don’t understand how Bitcoin works.”

This is not an argument. It’s a lazy dismissal used when someone doesn’t want to engage in honest discussion. Bitcoin was designed to be a system where anyone can verify the rules not just those who contribute to the GitHub repo. Saying someone “doesn’t understand Bitcoin” because they’ve never submitted a commit is the exact elitist mindset Bitcoin was built to reject.

You do not need to be a Core developer to understand the implications of putting arbitrary data on a blockchain. You need logic and a grasp of what it means to operate a decentralized, permissionless financial system that persists across borders and jurisdictions.

2. “Kratter and Mechanic are not developers and have never submitted commits, so they don’t understand Bitcoin.”

This is a classic appeal to authority fallacy. Bitcoin is not a dictatorship run solely by Core developers. It’s a network of users, node operators, businesses, and yes, enthusiasts and researchers who critically analyze and discuss the protocol. Understanding Bitcoin deeply does not require commit access. It requires careful study, analysis, and participation.

Matt Kratter and Mechanic have spent years researching, explaining, and engaging with Bitcoin’s technical details and policy debates. They break down complex changes for the community in ways that are accessible but grounded in facts. To label them “propagandists” because they don’t write code is dismissive and closes the door to any critical voices outside your small inner circle.

3. “You fell for propaganda from people who aren’t developers.”

So only developers can criticize the software? Only those with commit access are allowed to point out risks? That’s not how decentralized systems work. Bitcoin is not a devocracy. It’s a network of users who enforce consensus rules by running their own nodes. Everyone running a node is participating in Bitcoin governance, and their opinions especially about what data they’re required to store matter.

Calling dissent “propaganda” is what centralized regimes do when they want to shut down uncomfortable truths.

4. “Running Bitcoin Knots won’t stop spam from entering the blockchain.”

This is a textbook strawman. No one said Knots prevents spam from entering the blockchain by itself. What it does is give users choice over which policies they follow and what their node relays and accepts in the mempool. Knots maintains sane, conservative default settings and refuses to blindly follow every policy update pushed through Core without broad consensus.

That’s not propaganda. That’s how Bitcoin is supposed to work: users choosing which rules to enforce.

When Core begins accepting arbitrarily large data payloads via OP_RETURN, and when it removes the safeguards that kept non-transactional data limited, the entire network is affected. Every full archival node must now store and serve that data. The fact that Bitcoin Knots refuses to default to that behavior is exactly why it exists. It’s not a patch. It’s a protective fork to keep Bitcoin from being misused as a decentralized dumpster for non-monetary content.

5. “This is misinformation.”

What specifically is misinformation? The OP_RETURN limit is being raised. The filtering of non-standard data is being weakened. Developers have discussed and moved forward with this without broad community involvement or explanation to the wider user base. This is all public information, available in GitHub issues and mailing list discussions.

The reason you won’t address the actual facts is because you know they’re correct and you’d rather paint them as “misinformation” to shut down the conversation.

6. “You can come back in a few weeks and see that Bitcoin is fine.”

This is not reassurance. This is willful ignorance. You’re hoping no one notices the damage until it’s irreversible. That’s how critical decisions get slipped through: with silence, censorship, and minimization.

Bitcoin will survive this month. That’s not the point. The point is what happens over time when you allow the blockchain to become a permanent data sink, vulnerable to abuse, legal scrutiny, and bloated infrastructure requirements that exclude everyday users from running full nodes.

You call it “fear-mongering.” But refusing to acknowledge precedent like explicit, illegal content already stored on-chain is not optimism. It’s negligence.

7. Why people are choosing Bitcoin Knots

They’re not choosing Knots because they think it can magically fix Bitcoin. They’re choosing it because it gives them back control. Because it doesn’t silently adopt every policy change from Core. Because it warns users before pushing experimental features that can have permanent consequences.

And most of all: because it listens to the community, not just to the few individuals with commit access.

Knots is now around 20% of reachable nodes. That’s not a fluke. It’s a growing segment of the network pushing back against quiet centralization and decisions being made without transparent, ecosystem-wide discussion.

Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin. The users are.

If you’re banning people for asking difficult questions, suppressing valid warnings, and throwing around ad hominems instead of engaging with the issues, you’re not protecting Bitcoin. You’re gatekeeping it.

The appeal to miners has mixed chances of success, but if anything would succeed, it should base on the damage these upcoming Core changes could reasonably be expected to do to miner earnings and the value of the network.

On Comparing Bitcoin with Gold,"Both gold and Bitcoin have excellent stock-to-flow in comparison to fiat money. Two good tools for savings, but I choose the digital one

Gold can not be:

* used to host uncensorable speech

* multisigned

* crossing borders as 12 words in one's head

* cheaply verified independent from transaction amount

* settled internationally within an hour

* foundation for proof-or-reserves with an off-chain signed message

* timelocked

Correct multisignature setup make bitcoins completely secure from any form of theft: govt or $5 wrench. Unfortunately, even less popular than self-custody, Bitcoin Cash branch of Bitcoin included

It is completely understandable that emergent generational divide is present, and that a lot of people will live to the end using gold for savings.

"bitcoin just reclaimed key resistance and analysts are calling for a ""massive move"" - shorts getting liquidated hard","btc touched $112,900 this morning and the technical setup is looking explosive. we're seeing key resistance levels flip to support and short liquidations are piling up.

the liquidation carnage

$14.32 million in btc short positions got liquidated within one hour as price broke back above $112k. shorts are getting absolutely destroyed and there's clear rotation out of bearish positions heading into us jobs data.

key levels everyone's watching

$112k is the critical level - michael van de poppe calling it ""another massive long opportunity"" if we break above. rekt capital says $113k needs to be reclaimed to ""fully confirm the breakout"".

the liquidity zones are sitting at $111,500-$113,000 with more clusters extending to $115k. if we clear these levels, the next move could be violent.

macro catalyst building

us jobs report drops today and traders are expecting it could show labor market weakness. 99.4% probability of 25bp fed rate cut in september according to cme fedwatch.

here's the setup: weak jobs data -rate cut certainty -risk-on rally. ""the us now has more unemployed people than job openings"" - this could force fed's hand.

technical momentum shifting

analyst skew noted ""$100m bought back"" and ""clear rotation out of shorts"". the bid depth held and we're seeing real demand step in above $110k support.

if jobs data comes in weak as expected, we could see the perfect storm of technical breakout + macro catalyst driving the next leg higher.

the bigger picture

this feels like the moment where macro and technicals align. shorts are trapped, institutions are positioned for rate cuts, and we're testing the upper bounds of this consolidation range.

either we break out here and see that ""massive move"" analysts are calling for, or we reject again and test lower support. but with fed policy turning dovish and technical momentum building, the odds favor the bulls.

what's your take? is this the breakout above $112k that sets up the next major rally or just another false break before more chop?",False,0,

Bitcoin Is Being Poisoned From Within.,"I don’t think enough people are paying attention to what’s happening with Bitcoin Core right now and it’s something everyone running a node needs to know about

There’s a big change coming in October that will raise the OP_RETURN data limit from 80 bytes up to 100 thousand bytes or more. If you’re new to Bitcoin, OP_RETURN is the part of a transaction where people can add extra data that is not related to moving bitcoin around. This was always kept very small to prevent the blockchain from being misused and to keep Bitcoin focused on money instead of becoming a permanent storage layer for unrelated content

Now the plan is to remove those limits and get rid of the filters that previously stopped non-standard data from flooding the network. This is serious because it means much larger pieces of arbitrary content can now be added directly to the blockchain. This is permanent and every full node stores this data forever. This is not a theory. In the past, sensitive and highly inappropriate material has been inserted into the blockchain. It was often disguised or encoded but these changes make it much easier for bad actors to insert content that could create serious problems for node operators

If you are running a full node with Core software especially if it is an archival node your computer will store and process this content automatically without you even knowing what is in it. In many places this could put users at risk depending on what is being stored. Most people running nodes have no idea this is even possible but it is now a very real issue

Some of the developers behind Core have started pushing these changes through without broad agreement. Not all of them but enough that it is causing concern. They are moving fast and ignoring feedback from parts of the community who have tried to raise issues and ask for more discussion. Comments on GitHub are reportedly being removed and those who have spoken out have had their input shut down. Luke Dashjr who maintains Bitcoin Knots has been very vocal about this and has warned for years about what these kinds of changes could do to the future of the network

Bitcoin Knots is an alternative full node software that keeps those important protections in place and does not automatically accept risky policy changes. It is maintained by Luke Dashjr who has a long history of standing up for Bitcoin’s core principles. Knots is fully compatible with the Bitcoin network and more and more users are starting to run it to protect themselves and the integrity of the system

Running your own Bitcoin Knots node is not just a smart option it is becoming necessary. This is how you take back control. When you run your own node you choose what rules you follow. Developers do not run Bitcoin users do. If you keep running Core without understanding these changes you are agreeing to them whether you meant to or not

Bitcoin Knots now makes up around 20 percent of reachable nodes which is a strong signal that people are pushing back. But we need more

If this change is allowed to move forward without resistance here is what happens next. The blockchain becomes overloaded with junk data. Storage and bandwidth requirements increase dramatically. Governments may begin to see Bitcoin as a liability. Fewer people will be able to run full nodes. Developers who care about Bitcoin’s principles may leave. Decentralization weakens. The network risks becoming legally questionable or even unusable in some regions. This is not fear mongering this is the path we are on if users do nothing

If you care about Bitcoin staying fast secure and focused on being a monetary network then you need to run Bitcoin Knots. Protect yourself from unknowingly storing problematic data and help keep the chain clean. We are at a turning point. Do not sit on the sidelines

Now is the time to take a stand by running your own node. Let the software you choose reflect what you believe in. Bitcoin only works because users enforce the rules. What you run today decides what Bitcoin becomes tomorrow

Bitcoin Is Being Poisoned From Within.,"this whole conversation is _extremely_ stupid. the filters in bitcoin knots do not work. they delay your non-mining node from acknowledging the existence of a perfectly valid transaction for maybe 10 minutes, until someone mines it, then your knots node processes it anyway. knots isn't preventing anything, and the prior data carrier limit value in core didn't work either.

if anyone tells a valid transaction to a miner, even if your personal node tries to drop it, the miner can confirm it and collect a fee. it became completely normalized to ask miners out of band to perform somersaults after blocks became saturated in 2017. miners like to get paid. it doesn't affect anything if your knots node pretends a pending transaction doesn't exist.

consensus has always allowed big OP_RETURN values. the limit in consensus was never 80 bytes. the 80 byte limit was a soft filter in core that everyone figured out could be easily bypassed. consensus also allows [STAMPS](https://docs.openstamp.io/introduction/btc-stamps) which don't use OP_RETURN or witness data at all. knots doesn't prevent STAMPS from propagating or getting included in a block and they are unprunable. the only thing that can change consensus is a real fork. the knots people refuse to advocate for any fork, unless it's for something brain damaged like decreasing the blocksize to 300kb.

knots is maintained by a mentally ill crazy person who has lost 200 bitcoins, had his dev keys leaked, and doxxed an entire conference full of people to law enforcement. his fork has diverged significantly from core and he is the only maintainer. no serious economic node runner is ever going to depend on this stupid crap for their business critical operations. that would be suicide.",True,20,⚠️ Alert ⚠️
