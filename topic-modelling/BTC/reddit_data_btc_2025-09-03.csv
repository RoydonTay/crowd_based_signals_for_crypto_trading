The truth about this BTC subreddit and BCH scammers.,"
The r/btc subreddit is not a Bitcoin subreddit. Roger Ver purchased the r/btc subreddit from the original creator over 9 years ago and filled it with his own moderators. And the r/btc subreddit has been used to promote the altcoin BCH and to spread misinformation & propaganda about bitcoin ever since. They hate Bitcoin. They love BCH. They keep recommending newbies to read Roger Ver's book because they are desperate to scam more newbies into thinking that BCH is bitcoin. They are BCH bag holders and they need newbies to buy their bags. They don't care about running nodes and they don't care about decentralization. And they won't tell you that Roger Ver literally said that increasing bitcoin's max block size, thus centralizing it and turning it into PayPal 2.0 is an acceptable risk for bitcoin scaling.(https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/78ruru/roger_ver_paypal_20_is_an_acceptable_risk_for/)

Bitcoin Cash is a centralized altcoin that uses the Bitcoin name in an attempt to trick users that are uneducated about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin Cash was created because a group of Bitcoin miners in China that controlled a large amount of Bitcoin's hashrate were using a secret mining enhancement called AsicBoost that gave them a 20% hashrate advantage. Bitcoin was going to implement segregated witness (SegWit) and SegWit is not compatible with AsicBoost. The majority of miners did not support SegWit because they were using AsicBoost and they wanted to keep using AsicBoost. But the users that were running fully validating nodes activated Segwit on their own. So a group of miners that wanted to keep using AsicBoost created the Bitcoin Cash hard fork.

Roger Ver, Jihan Wu (the owner of Bitmain and AntPool), and the billionaire Calvin Ayre were all pumping the price of bitcoin cаsһ and Roger and Jihan were dumping a ton of BTC on big exchanges for BCH. The bcashers thought that if they could get the price of BCH high enough and make BCH more profitable to mine, then most of the Bitcoin miners would switch over and BCH's price would stay above Bitcoin's price forever. Their plan failed.

Look at the BCH price chart: https://i.redd.it/a4me7bh9nhcf1.png

On that chart you can see where Roger, Jihan, and Calvin were dumping BTC on exchanges for BCH at the beginning to inflate the price of BCH and suppress the price of BTC.

BCH currently only has 0.47% of the hashrate of Bitcoin(https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate) (BCH is abysmally insecure. BCH's hashrate fluctuates between 0.10% and 1% of Bitcoin's hashrate) And there are currently only 605 BCH nodes(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/nodes). Meanwhile, there are approximately 88,000 Bitcoin nodes(https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html) and there's even 14,624 public Lightning Network nodes(https://bitcoinvisuals.com/lightning). So there are currently 147 times more Bitcoin nodes operating than there are BCH nodes operating and there are currently 24 times more Lightning nodes operating than there are BCH nodes operating. Not to mention that a single group controlled 80% of BCH's hashrate for a long time (the same group that created BCH) and AntPool alone controlled over 50% of the BCH hashrate for years.

The fact is that BCH has no long term future and I'll explain exactly why in the following two paragraphs.

In case you aren't aware, the transaction fees in each BCH block are less than 5 worth of BCH 99% of the time, and usually less than 1 worth of BCH. For example, this is the most recently mined BCH block(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913567). As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00022314 BCH (worth only 12 cents) of transaction fees and this is completely normal for a BCH block. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913566) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.0008133 BCH (worth only 44 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913565) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00116919 BCH (worth only 64 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913564) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00016649 BCH (worth only only 9 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913563) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00050543 BCH (worth only 27 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913562) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00004355 BCH (worth less than 2 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913561) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00190039 BCH (worth only 1 dollar & 5 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913560) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00125895 BCH (worth only 69 cents) of transaction fees.

And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913556) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00105167 BCH (worth only 58 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913555) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00015486 BCH (worth only 8 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913554) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00003442 BCH (worth less than 2 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913553) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00011303 BCH (worth only 6 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913552) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00000841 BCH (worth only less than 1 cent) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913551) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00000313 BCH (worth less than 1 cent) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913550) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00140395 BCH (worth only 77 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block.(https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/913549) As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00006795 BCH (worth only 3 cents) of transaction fees. I could go on like this all day but I think you get the point by now. As you can see, having almost no fees in each block is completely normal for BCH. The point that I'm trying to make is that unlike BCH, there will actually be something to incentivize miners to continue mining bitcoin after over 99% of the block subsidy is gone in 2035.

The fact is that bcashers are holding heavy bags of a centralized altcoin that has no future. Some of the bcashers paid as much as 0.3 BTC for each single BCH after the chain split. The bcashers need to keep tricking more newbies into believing that BCH is the real Bitcoin and get them to buy their heavy BCH bags. They are desperate for exit liquidity. The bcashers lie and spread misinformation & propaganda about Bitcoin, but they are just attempting to trick more people that don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency into believing that BCH is Bitcoin. Many of the bcashers have been scammed but are just too stupid to realize it and the rest of the bcashers are scammers themselves.

"Question about revealing key and transaction ""addresses"" with Bitcoin","One thing I discovered at the last BTC halving, everyone flooded the mempool with stupid ordinals and stuff, and the TX fees on BTC went to $200:

Most major Lightning Node operators automatically adjust the ""channel reserve"" to be a multiple of whatever the on-chain BTC fees are.  

So if you open a lightning channel with roughly $1000, and you spend some, have about $500 remaining outbound liquidity.   Then fees spike to $200.    The common practice is ""3x dust limit"".   So the channel reserve would be about $600, and that would totally eat the $500 left of outbound liquidity.

BCH to BTC Ratio Soars as Supply Squeeze and ETF Hype Build,"The BCH to BTC ratio has reached its highest point in over nine months, a level not seen since early December 2024. This increase comes as balances on Western exchanges have hit multi-year lows.



Daily buyers have been purchasing and withdrawing coins to self-custody, leading to a supply squeeze. As a result, there are few coins available for sale without a significant increase in the market price.



This is happening right before the SEC is expected to release new crypto ETF guidelines. These new rules will likely allow companies to apply for multiple ETFs at once, which could reduce costs, uncertainty, and approval times. This could lead to a price boost for cryptocurrencies, including BCH, at several key stages:



When the guidelines are released.



When companies apply for BCH ETFs.



When the ETFs are approved and listed.



When options are added to the ETFs.



Once a BCH ETF is listed, the increased demand from investors could further tighten the supply of available coins.

  


In anticipation of these changes, Grayscale has been consistently filing for new ETFs, even for coins with a much lower market capitalization, like Polkadot, which was recently ranked 25th. Grayscale is likely waiting for the new SEC guidelines to convert its existing funds into ETFs. For assets like Polkadot, for which they do not currently have a fund, they are filing for new ETFs directly rather than creating new closed-end funds like their other products. Meanwhile, BCH is currently ranked 15th and, until recently, was Grayscale's top single-asset crypto fund.

"japanese company just got shareholder approval to raise $3.7 billion for bitcoin. their goal: 210,000 btc by 2027.","tl;dr: Metaplanet just got shareholder approval to raise $3.7B to buy 210k BTC (1% of supply) by 2027. They’re building a corporate bitcoin accumulation machine.

metaplanet shareholders just voted to completely overhaul their capital structure, clearing the path for what might be the largest corporate bitcoin accumulation play we've ever seen.

the numbers are absolutely staggering:

 $3.7 billion fundraising target
 goal of 210,000 btc by end of 2027
 currently hold 20,000 btc (6th largest corporate treasury)
 just bought another 1,009 btc on monday for $112 million

to put this in perspective: 210,000 btc represents 1% of bitcoin's total supply. one japanese company is trying to corner 1% of all bitcoin that will ever exist.

the financial engineering is brilliant:

they created a dual-class preferred stock system:
 class a shares: fixed dividends for income investors
 class b shares: convertible to common stock for upside exposure

this lets them raise massive capital while protecting existing shareholders from dilution. it's basically a ""defensive mechanism"" that unlocks billions in funding without destroying shareholder value.

they're building a bitcoin acquisition machine:

metaplanet expanded authorized shares to 2.7 billion shares. that's the infrastructure to raise serious institutional money specifically for bitcoin accumulation.

the board already approved international offerings. now it's just about filing with regulators and finding investors willing to bet $3.7 billion on bitcoin.

the timing is perfect:

while their stock is down 54% from june highs (trading at $5.74), that might actually help with the fundraise. investors can get exposure to their bitcoin strategy at a discount.

plus they're already proving the model works - they're the 6th largest corporate bitcoin holder and actively adding to their position.

the accounting complexity is insane:
systematically buying 210,000 btc over three years creates massive reporting requirements. these corporate treasuries will need sophisticated tracking systems - tools like awaken.tax become essential when you're managing billions in crypto transactions across multiple jurisdictions with different tax treatments.

this is institutional fomo at scale:

when a japanese public company gets shareholder approval to raise $3.7 billion specifically to buy bitcoin, that's not speculation anymore. that's institutional conviction.

they're not buying bitcoin as a small treasury allocation. they're rebuilding their entire business around bitcoin accumulation.

the supply shock implications:

if metaplanet hits their 210,000 btc target by 2027:
 that's 1% of total bitcoin supply off the market
 microstrategy holds ~632k btc (3% of supply)
 combined with other corporate treasuries, we're looking at 5%+ of bitcoin permanently locked up

The precedent this sets

metaplanet is showing other corporations exactly how to structure a massive bitcoin acquisition play:
 get shareholder approval 
 create dual-class shares to prevent dilution
 raise billions through international offerings
 systematically accumulate bitcoin over multi-year timeline

expect other companies to copy this playbook.

my take: this changes everything

$3.7 billion earmarked specifically for bitcoin purchases. 210,000 btc target. systematic accumulation over 3 years.

this isn't some ceo buying bitcoin with spare cash. this is a complete corporate transformation into a bitcoin accumulation vehicle with billions in funding.

if they pull this off, metaplanet becomes one of the largest bitcoin holders on the planet. and they're showing every other corporation how to do it.

what do you think? is this the template for how corporate bitcoin adoption scales to the next level?

"Block Point (BPTS) can incentivize using Bitcoin Cash, even if the coins being used aren't ""yours"".","There are a number of established contracts on Bitcoin Cash holding sometimes significant amounts of capital, but where anyone may create a transaction that moves that capital, for a few hundred satoshis. These are cauldron threads, FBCH threads, and WBCH to name a few; the contracts don't restrict the total number or shape of transaction inputs, they instead restrict outputs on a per input basis.

There's also, a CashToken on Bitcoin Cash [called ""Block Points""](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/block-points-airdrop-token/1554) where anyone may take tokens from a vault, provided they happen to be moving some ""aged"" capital in the first input of the transaction.

So... what does this mean? Well. It should be possible, if there were a 1 BCH output in the [WBCH contract](https://wrapped.cash/) that was a week old, for ANYONE to be able to move that thread, and claim about 1000 BPTS in the same transaction.

    WBCH vault       -> WBCH vault
    BlockPoint Vault -> BlockPoint Vault
                     -> 1000 BPTS ""profit""

So with Block Points, not only do users not have to encumber coins in a Vault to redeem a yield (they can use coins that have been sitting in a wallet). But they can use coins encumbered by vault, even of those coins aren't ""theirs"".

The tokenmoics of Block Points are similar to Badgers, in that, each 20 sats in the per token price equates to about 1% APY.

So if a party claiming Block Points from anyone can spend contracts amassed a million BPTS, and they felt a 1% APY was a fair yield for doing so, they might list those 1M BPTS on tapswap. And any party that saw a 1% APY as a fair market yield might buy them for roughly 20M sats.",False,5,

And I’m a bitcoiner at heart but look. 

Fiat go down yes. 

But fiat only bad for normies….. 

When you have billions you can leverage debt against it at like 0.01% interest…. 

Then you can take that money and go buy assets that will pay a yield higher than the inflation rate of fiat and your interest payments, also your interest payments become “less” because you’re paying it out overtime as fiat deflates. 

So in reality fiat is the perfect instrument for the extremely wealthy and truthfully that’s where my skepticism lies in Bitcoin. 

It only makes sense for regular people. 

But the rich control about 38% of the world’s wealth. 

Some of it might touch bitcoin but if you’re a billionaire ask yourself. 

What’s so good about Bitcoin other than a slight hedge or short term speculation ? 

If I’m wrong about anything as a billionaire, I’m systemic, I can just get bailed out by big institutions or other wealthy individuals, and in some cases the government itself (JP Morgan 2008 financial crisis) 


It’ll be interesting to see what happens to say the least but I no longer objectively believe 100% of the world’s wealth will go to Bitcoin. Maybe 10-20% max imo. 

I still think it can go up forever though because that 10-20% is relative to the amount of GDP or global wealth (depending on which one you want to account for) 

As global wealth and GDP grows I could still see Bitcoin maintaining that 10-20% but truthfully, I don’t think it gets passed that.

The unraveling of the great con,"As most in the know are aware of, BTC is functionally useless. To be precise, it doesn‘t scale. And it‘s L2 is a joke. Why it doesn‘t scale is besides at this point, if it would‘ve ever done so, that time has long past since 2017, and it never done it since, so the point is moot. It‘s not gonna scale.

This is a problem, because a useless crippled shitcoin isn‘t exactly gonna work out well to be bought up by everyone. They‘re gonna figure it out eventually. And that‘s when the fun times starts. Because it means most of the crypto markets valuation will, some day, go for a walk in the park and never come back. That‘s gonna leave a lot of people and companies pretty upset. They might say a choice word or two. And crypto, all of it, will be a laughing stock for an indeterminate amount of time.

We can‘t avoid this problem. We tried. But now it‘s too late. I tell you this, not as a prediction, but as a precaution. You might squabble about the likelihood of such events, and it may never occur, granted. Though I believe it‘s very likely to occur on account of the facts. It may happen at any point in time, or never, and be mostly over before anyone was able to move their funds (on account of the trading bots). You will not be able to trade your way out of this one, or even limit your losses. Exchanges will fold like going out of business is a new hot trend, by the time you want to trade, the exchange is bust or closed and whatever funds where in it is now bankruptcy frozen. And as for institutional investors, they‘re even more screwed, because they hold illiquid positions, i.e. positions too large to quickly move them on the markets without cratering them.

"2022-2025, BCH exchange wallets tell the fascinating story of panic sellers selling low, smart money absorbing liquidations, and long term investors buying daily to DCA/invest outpacing limited mining rewards and liquid supply.","When a person or entity sells an asset at a very low price, often due to panic, financial distress, or a forced liquidation, this is known as a distressed sale. The assets are usually purchased by buyers who have a longer-term perspective and the financial capacity to take advantage of the low price. These buyers may include institutions, liquidity providers, or savvy retail investors.



**2022 Bear market:**



In the 2022 bear market, BCH experienced a significant downturn, with prices plummeting from over $1,000 to as low as $100. This steep decline was fueled by a number of factors, including:

* **Forced liquidations** of highly-leveraged investors.
* The **exit scam** by crypto exchange CoinFLEX, which resulted in the forced liquidation of hundreds of thousands of BCH.
* **Panic selling** by investors who sold their holdings at any price to avoid further losses.

This massive sell-off created a temporary oversupply of BCH on the market. However, institutions, liquidity providers, and experienced retail buyers quickly stepped in to buy up every available coin in the $100–$200 range. These buyers were able to acquire BCH at a deeply discounted price, recognizing that the long-term fundamentals of the asset remained strong despite the temporary panic.

The price of BCH simply couldn't stay that low forever. The supply of BCH is static, with new coins only entering circulation through mining rewards, which were already below demand. The massive sell-off was a one-time event that temporarily flooded the market with coins. Once these distressed assets were bought up by new holders, they were taken off the market, and the supply of BCH for sale became scarce again. This created a floor price for the asset, and the price gradually started to increase over time.

**Panic Selling vs. Strategic Buying**

Panic sellers often act on emotion, selling low and buying high. When prices are low, they declare the asset ""dead"" and sell everything. But when prices rise, they become euphoric and buy back in. In contrast, strategic buyers with long-term vision, like the market makers and liquidity providers who stepped in, purchased BCH when it was being liquidated for cents on the dollar, effectively creating a floor price for the asset.

**The Power of Limited Supply**

Assets with a limited supply, like BCH, can't keep up with consistent demand. As new buyers enter the market, the available supply for sale decreases. This dynamic can be temporarily disrupted by one-off events, such as large-scale liquidations, but once the distressed supply is absorbed by new holders, demand can quickly outpace supply, leading to price appreciation.",False,8,📰 Report
Does BTC truly belong to the people now?,"What is the most reliable analysis showing how fairly Bitcoin is distributed among its holders?

The usual measure for wealth concentration is the Gini coefficient, which indicates how unequally wealth is spread. For traditional wealth, the Gini  of 0.8  shows that 20% percentage of people hold 80% of total wealth. In Bitcoin, however, reported Gini coefficients vary widely depending on the calculation method between 0.65 to 0.98, making it unclear how fair the distribution really is.

Which analysis can be considered the most realistic?

From my perspective, the fact that “shrimps” (addresses holding less than 1 BTC) collectively own only around 7% of the supply suggests that Bitcoin was effectively captured by a small group of early whales: https://bitinfocharts.com/de/bitcoin-distribution-history.html

While large institutions own only about 8% of the total BTC supply, and only 8% are on exchanges:
 https://www.coinglass.com/Balance
the other 70-80% are in hands of some whales: https://bitcointreasuries.net

If those whales bought millions of BTC for just a few cents, then true generational wealth through Bitcoin may not be possible for newcomers. At best, it might outperform the S&P 500 over time—but mainly as whales gradually liquidate their enormous early holdings.

"With Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, you can have it both ways (for some time)","If you believe that a new form of money first needs adoption and use before it becomes a store of value, then you should get some BCH and use it.

If you believe a new money can be a better store of value before being hoovered up by the ultra-rich and taken out of general circulation, but then somehow it can surpass this filter and _still_ become a widely used medium of exchange while retaining the benefits of original Bitcoin:

- practical self-custodianship (""be your own bank"", fully control your own wealth)
- permissionlessness
- low friction to transact, in all respects
- competitive transaction fees
- high (best?) network reliabity
- ability to defend the accruing value of the network through Proof of Work (with increasing difficulty of generating new coins)
- decentralized algorithm to achieve consensus (i.e. mining doesn't collapse to utterly centralized state)
- open protocol and open source development to avoid capture

Then IMO you should consider to also acquire some BTC (and hold it or use it).

If you are not sure about which comes first, the medium of exchange or the store of value, or if indeed they might both grow side by side, then you can acquire _both_ BCH and BTC and use them as you see fit. You can even stabilize (hedge) the fiat value of some of your BCH through [on-chain hedging contracts](https://bchbull.com), if the price charts give you anxiety.

This way, you can have the best of both worlds for a time, until one of them becomes dominant as a medium of exchange, at which time you can live the ""Neo"" meme where you don't have to sell your bitcoins for them to be usable as money.

All the above is, to be sure, my own opinion.

I am just presenting it because very often, maximalists will not even introduce you to the possibility that you can use more than one system at a time.

And if you are thinking along, then this means that Bitcoin (and Bitcoin Cash) is also under pressure from other cryptocurrencies and even things like future CBDCs, and the outcome of the whole thing is still uncertain.

Bitcoin & Inheritance (safely leaving behind BTC to family),"I’ve built a decent Bitcoin stack over the last few years which is safely tucked away in cold storage. I’m a new-ish father with a second child on the way.

Bitcoin & Inheritance (safely leaving behind BTC to family),Best answer is education. Get all of your family their own wallets. Even if they only have $10 in it that's enough for them to get familiar with it. When the kids are old enough show them how to make their own private keys and how to keep them safe. Encourage them to buy it themselves and go through the process of selling it. Zero reason for them to know about the inheritance.

When you accept the reality, you'll understand that gold is noting more than a **""Barbarous Relic""** 1924.

Begging the question, what is money?  In 1912 JP Morgan made the clear distinction between *money* and credit.  When he says, “**Money is Gold, Nothing Else”**. Pre FED.

Unlike credit, and like gold, Bitcoin is not dependent on a third party “coming through” on the obligations.

The reality is gold is not money any more, it was once money, now golds value is for the most part a meme.

**Money is accounting for the exchange of value in an economy.** Our modern economies are broken because we inaptly understand the function of money but allow it to be created at will, and then we work for this money created out of thin air exchanging our energy, wealth and time for nothing but the often irrational will of those who have the power to create it through credit or just plain money printing/mouse clicking.

Our understanding of money is further degraded because we think of it as wealth, chasing money for money's sake.

Gold is coasting on a pre-1913-Central bank narrative. The reality is Gold is valuable in electronics and at today's price it is only about $6 per person that's needed to fulfill that function. That demand is insufficient to justify the current price.

North Korean Hackers,"If your exchange is centralized and doesn't have proof of on-chain reserves, then its bitcoins are likely already fake.

Fake bitcoins are when someone pretends to have bitcoins without proving it. Many exchanges in the past have done this, and many probably still do.

Best way to prove an exchange's coins are real, is to withdraw them from the exchange.",True,1,❗Caution Advised
North Korean Hackers,"Anyone can try to double spend, i.e. broadcast many transactions of spending the same bitcoin and sending it to different addresses. If an exchange is coded poorly, especially if it’s configured to be forgiving in the first place (maybe to reduce false customer support issues), then exploitation could be possible.

The origiinal whitepaper suggested 6 block confirmations before accepting any funds as fully received. That could take 2 hours when blocks aren’t sticking to their average. Even today, many CEXs don’t wait that long to let you trade with your deposit.

Mt Gox was infamous for being run with absolutely no structure or standards. Many early exchanges were opened by inexperienced devs that were just winging things. It worked great until it didn’t. And it’s not just newb traders who jump in with an exchange without due diligence. Read all about FTX… the CEO was running things with no established standards or audits and had attracted money from the world’s largest institutional investors.

The point is, “fake bitcoins” as described in the quoted article, is a misleading term and nothing to do with a weakness in the bitcoin protocol.",True,1,❗Caution Advised
North Korean Hackers,"Hackers can’t make real Bitcoin. They just tricked the exchange’s system into “thinking” fake deposits were real, then cashed out before it noticed.
