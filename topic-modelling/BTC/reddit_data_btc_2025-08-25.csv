Bitcoin now makes up 1.7% of all global money... that's actually insane when you think about it,"Just saw this River analysis and had to share. Bitcoin hit 1.7% of global money supply when we peaked at $2.4T market cap earlier this month. They're counting all major fiat currencies ($112.9T) plus gold and other hard money ($25.1T) in that calculation.

We're sitting around $2.29T now so closer to 1.66%, but still... in 16 years we went from literally nothing to nearly 2% of ALL money on earth. That includes every dollar, euro, yen, pound, plus gold reserves.

The Fed stuff is interesting too**:**  
Powell basically confirmed rate cuts are coming at Jackson Hole on Friday. Bitcoin jumped 2% right after his speech and hit $116,000. CME data shows 75% of investors expect a 25 basis point cut in September.

Here's what gets me though - central banks keep printing more fiat while Bitcoin's supply stays fixed. Every time they fire up the money printer, our slice of the pie gets bigger just by existing. We don't even have to do anything.

Gold and Bitcoin are basically eating the lunch of every fiat currency right now. The purchasing power destruction is real and people are waking up to it.

Pretty wild that something that started as a whitepaper is now competing with currencies that took centuries to establish. Makes you wonder what 5% or 10% looks like if this trend continues.

Anyone else think we're still early at under 2%? Or are we getting ahead of ourselves here?",False,44,

How so?

Keeping in mind this: 

* https://jlopp.github.io/unspendable-utxo-calculator

* https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/mining/block-reward

BTC block can fit 4.4k P2PKH 1-to-2 UTXOs currently. Let's say feerate would stay at 1sat/byte long-term: if, like right now, market solves congestions not with fee bidding, but with delaying, custodianship or use of other chains. 225 bytes each UTXO, ~0.01 BTC per filled block

So, if chain usage just stays the same dynamically, then ~50:50 reward to fees ratio in 2056 and ~90:10 in 2072, and smooth sail to ~100:0 in 2100s

And for Bitcoin Cash, thanks to ABLA, it will completely depend on demand for on-chain usage. High demand - it could go to mostly fees-based reward very quickly

Security-wise: current near-ATH of BTC in USD is translated about 800 equivalent PoW days worth of security, https://fork.lol/security/chain.

btc max price,"Hello everyone,

I've been playing around with some numbers and wanted to share the idea (maybe someone will correct me if I'm wrong).

If we think of a scenario where BTC was the only global money, we can use the equation of exchange:

M \times V = P \times Y

Where:

 = money in circulation (BTC × price).

 = velocity of money (how many times it rotates per year).

 = World nominal GDP.


Global nominal GDP today is around USD 113–114 trillion (IMF 2025).

 The useful supply of BTC is ~18 million (discounting those that have been lost).

So, solving:

\text{BTC Price} = \frac{GDP\_{\text{world}}}{V \times 18,000,000}

If we take typical values ​​of (between 3 and 6), it gives us a range:

V = 3 → ~2.1M USD/BTC

V = 4 → ~1.6M USD/BTC

V = 5 → ~1.3M USD/BTC

V = 6 → ~1.0 M USD/BTC


That is, for BTC to cover the global money function and “replicate” the current money supply, it would need a value in the range of ~1–2 million USD per BTC (perhaps up to 3–4 million if we use a lower money velocity or consider lost BTC).

Obviously, this calculation is theoretical and simplified:

It does not contemplate future GDP growth.

It does not contemplate that States will continue printing fiat currency in the meantime → therefore the “equilibrium price” would move higher over time.

It also does not consider strategic reserves, savings, immobilized BTC, or credit dynamics that could modify the speed.


The intention is to have a more or less well-founded idea of ​​what the BTC ceiling may be until it stabilizes and enters a stage of slow delation that makes it more useful as cash and not so much as a speculative asset or reserve of value.

Does this reasoning make sense or am I missing something key?",False,0,

"Binance froze my funds for 30 days, then sent my withdrawal to the wrong address and blamed it on malware 🤡","I need to share what just happened because it’s absolutely insane and people should know how Binance treats its users.

Binance opened a bogus $197 “dispute” against me and froze ALL my funds for 30 days straight. Every single day I was threatened — my account would be suspended, closed, or funds withheld unless I paid.

After the 30 days expired, they closed the case themselves without my compliance. Fine, I thought, finally done.

I go to withdraw \~$2,300 BTC to my whitelisted Trezor address — the one I had saved long ago. I didn’t type anything, didn’t paste anything, just clicked the dropdown.

Guess what? Binance sends my money to a completely different Bitcoin address that is NOT mine. When I confronted them, they had the audacity to blame it on “malware” on my device. 🤦‍♂️

Here’s the kicker: their own system behavior proves that’s impossible. If the address had been tampered with locally, Binance’s backend would’ve flagged it as a new address and forced network selection + 2FA. That never happened. They admitted themselves that the transaction was processed as whitelisted. Which means the mistake was inside Binance, not on my machine.

So after 30 days of threats and frozen funds, my very next withdrawal gets “misrouted” to a random address, and they blame me. This isn’t an accident anymore — it looks like retaliation for not bowing to their $197 shakedown.

I have the blockchain records, I have the screenshots of their UI logic, I have the chat transcripts where they basically admit it went through as whitelisted.

This company is a predatory custodian that overrides its own security guarantees when it suits them. If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone. And the fact that they’re hiding behind “malware” excuses while bypassing their billion-dollar whitelist infrastructure is beyond laughable.

People really need to think twice before leaving any serious money on Binance.

Yeah, BTC will be 1m dollars, but that single bitcoin won't even buy you a trailer in even the methiest of trailer parks. BTC isn't going up! The US $$$ is going down

Now, obviously massive devaluation of the US dollar (like we are *currently* seeing) is going to be worse than a bull in a china shop, it'll be a little kid in the Eastern Diamondback Rattler store.

Then viola! The billionaires debts are worthless, and even though their money is also worth less, everyone else will be even worse off, and isn't that really what this whole billionaire thing is? These people aren't happy with riches unless someone else has less as a result. They want *relative wealth*. Seriously, had our nation just stopped electing republicans after Nixon (actually pretty progressive for a R), and we had a series of progressive leaders, *these billionaires would be substantially richer,* probably exponentially so.

But it wouldn't be as big of a gap between that wealth and the bottom of the pyramid (suspiciously so) shaped economic system' wealth.

There are plenty of phrases and idioms that are appropriate here, so I'm just going to reiterate the one that (IMO) the most people need to get this through their (between 3.7 × 10\^17 kg/m³ - 6 × 10\^17 kg/m³) skulls.

These people would rather be kings of a wasteland than citizens of a literal utopia.

And they are playing with fire. So many people have lost so much,  we aren't even a year in. Every villain knows you don't take everything from a man, because then you've given him nothing to lose.

No billionaire alive today has ever learned that lesson, *actually had to learn it*, outside of history or literature.

CoinBase ceo brian armstrong says bitcoin could hit $1m by 2030... why its pure and utter overestimation?,"so coinbase's ceo just said bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2030. that's roughly 8x from current levels in about 5 years. sounds wild but let me walk through why this might actually happen.

the math behind it:

bitcoin would need to average about 45% annual gains to hit $1m by 2030. historically, btc has averaged way higher returns over multi-year periods, so the percentage isn't impossible.

but here's what would need to happen:

institutional adoption at scale we're already seeing companies like bitmine accumulating massive eth positions. if similar moves happen with bitcoin at the corporate treasury level, that's a lot of supply getting locked up.

government and sovereign adoption countries are starting to add bitcoin to reserves. if major economies follow el salvador's lead, demand could explode while supply stays fixed at 21 million coins.

currency debasement continues with central banks trapped by government debt (keeping rates artificially low), traditional currencies keep losing purchasing power. bitcoin becomes more attractive as digital gold.

why armstrong might be onto something:

coinbase sees institutional demand that retail doesn't

they see the actual money flows happening behind the scenes

their business only works if crypto succeeds, so they're motivated to be realistic

bitcoin's fixed supply becomes more obvious as more people want it

why he might be wrong:

regulatory crackdowns could stunt growth

competing cryptocurrencies could eat bitcoin's market share

technical issues or security problems could derail adoption

economic crashes typically hit risk assets hardest

my take:

$1m sounds nuts until you remember we just went from $15k to $124k in less than 3 years. that's already an 8x move in a shorter timeframe.

the real question isn't whether bitcoin can 8x again - it's whether the stuff that got us here (money printing, institutions buying, currencies getting weaker) keeps happening for another 5 years.

if central banks stay trapped by debt and keep rates low while governments keep spending, armstrong's prediction might actually be conservative.

what this means for coinbase users:

whether you believe the $1m target or not, coinbase is clearly positioning for massive growth. they're building infrastructure assuming crypto gets way bigger than it is today.

Indeed, it isn't impossible in the sense that the probability of it happening is not exact zero.

That said, let's check the plot of averaged annualized returns of BTC. We can easily see that the average annualized logarithmic returns over four-year periods were around 103% in 2016. As opposed to that, in 2023, the annualized average logarithmic returns over four-year periods were around 37%. Moreover, the annualized average logarithmic returns were quite steadily decreasing during the 2016-2023 period.

are we looking at a bitcoin cycle top in the next 2-3 months?,"glassnode just dropped some analysis that has me thinking about where we are in this cycle. the data is pointing to bitcoin being in a historically late phase right now.

the numbers:

bitcoin went from $15,500 in november 2022 to $124,500 last week - that's a 700% rally. when you compare this timing to previous cycles, we're apparently about 2-3 months away from where past cycle tops occurred.

currently 91% of all bitcoin is in profit and has been above the +1 standard deviation band for 273 days. that's the second longest stretch on record, only behind the 2015-2018 cycle that hit 335 days.

profit taking patterns:

long-term holders (people who held for 155+ days) have been taking profits at levels comparable to previous euphoric phases. this kind of selling pressure typically happens near cycle tops.

rekt capital says if bitcoin follows historical halving cycles, the peak would be mid-september to mid-october 2025. that's literally 1-2 months away.

current price action:

bitcoin got rejected at $114,000 yesterday after bouncing from $112,000 support. if we lose that $110,000-$112,000 zone, analysts are saying we could drop back into the $90,000-$100,000 range pretty quickly.

what this means:

look, nobody knows exactly when tops happen until after they're done. but when you have:

700% gains from cycle lows

91% of supply in profit for 273 days straight

long-term holders selling at euphoric levels

price getting rejected at key resistance

it starts looking like we might be closer to the end than the beginning of this run.

my take:

this doesn't mean bitcoin crashes tomorrow. we could still push higher and extend this cycle. but the risk/reward is definitely shifting. if you've been riding this from the lows, maybe consider taking some profits. if you are taking profits, make sure you're tracking everything properly for tax season. tools like awaken.tax can help you stay on top of the reporting side while you focus on the trading decisions.

the $110,000-$112,000 zone is probably make or break right now. hold that and we might get another push higher. lose it and things could get interesting fast.

BCH halving is shaping up as one of Q3’s sleeper trades,"Bitcoin Cash is quietly setting up one of the most interesting plays this quarter. After spiking past $600 earlier in August, BCH has cooled into the mid-$500s with the market pullback. For some that looks like weakness - for others, it looks like the kind of entry point halvings are made for.  
  
The event is only weeks away. Block rewards get cut, new supply tightens, and historically these moments have sparked explosive short-term rallies. Technicals still lean bullish (MACD crossover, RSI not overbought, volumes steady), so the structure is there.  
  
What makes it even better is that BCH is one of the few majors with an active incentive to hold right now. On Nеxо, BCH balances are earning daily compounding interest plus an extra 3% in kind through November. For anyone sitting on BCH into the halving, that’s effectively stacking while waiting for the supply shock narrative to unfold.  
  
Some will dismiss it as exit liquidity, others will see it for what it is: a rare chance to get paid twice - once by the market, once by the structure around it.",False,0,

Calls to Action. Thoughts on Ensuring Success of Peer-to-Peer Cash,"Let's define terms

16 years have passed since Genesis block, Bitcoin is ticking in two branches of BTC and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash is a Bitcoin, it's more elegant chain, but has lesser network effect. ASERT and ABLA are important improvements. I consider Segwit and RBF sand in the Bitcoin machine. By p2p cash on this forum I mean the crypto iteration, Bitcoin 2015 and BCH, if you will. By network effect of a given crypto I mean amount of people engage with protocol in various manner, in concentric circles: being aware, talking, having coins, running a business, creating infrastructure of hardware and software

My estimation is that network effect of BTC is much greater that this of DOGE, BCH, XMR, LTC (other biggest open blockchains) and ETH (most decentralized private money, closed in 2022) 

I don't agree that custodianship trend is caused by higher fees on BTC, p2p cash is the problem, so to speak. I think it's due to level of sophistication that is needed to securely manage one's private keys. BIP39 was important step there long ago. But nothing significant happened since. Managing keys with Electon Cash or Selene on BCH is fundamentally the same as doing so on Electrum back in 2015 over unified Bitcoin chain - from operational security standpoint. This is my perspective: while both operating coins and teaching willing people - technical barrier is just too high


User DangerHighVoltage111 (now deleted for some reason) was responding to me in several threads about importance of p2p cash philosophy. And he created a thread with a call to action of not listening to sirens, presumably myself included - and to teach people

My post is a call to action as well:

* **education**: as DangerHighVoltage111 called, I also call for teaching willing people whenever possible, maybe I am simply wrong about severity of key management problem and growth of network effect of BCH would take care of everything

* **uncensorable speech**: there is tremendous unrealized value of uncensorable speech, potential to overlay all content on the Internet with built-in monetization and user-moderated rating system and commentary, serverless, as hashes on chain (BitTorrent seems the best fit) and well-thought UI unwrapping it: allowing users to bootstrap from zero, without DNS-dependence, locally follow and engage in monetization, donate to content providers. Something, that Memo fell short off, extremely unfortunately. I'm calling for smarter people than myself to develop it (meanwhile, I need capital, and hopefully will have extra at some point - to sponsor it)

PoW, low fees, UTXO system and improvements in OP_RETURN make BCH the best posed open blockchain for this

Hopefully, shattering god-awful ad-based data mining Internet of 2025 to pieces. Admittedly, a big ask

* **key management**: I call for capable people to think about jump to BIP39 and standing still since then, maybe software solution exists which could turn crypto p2p cash into a tool that is as easy to manage as physical cash - which is life saving for poorest productive people across the world

I stand for maximizing economic freedom, and I also stand for not being blind about dynamics in the real world. I'm both heavily allocated in BTC and not giving up on BCH for a reason

> I don't agree that custodianship trend is caused by higher fees on BTC, 

As I have said elsewhere I believe it's mainly, that there is no pressing need to move away from custodians at the moment (as that's where the majority get their coins, why move?), combine that with general apathy and finally as you say the level of competence needed.


> p2p cash is the problem

I would agree, but not in the way that I think you mean


I would say the lack of '*a p2p cash* ***usecase***' is the problem. 


There are not enough places where one can spend their p2p cash at the moment. And if there are places that sell something you want, it's not easy to hunt down, I just spent a couple of hours tracking down somewhere I could spend $200+ (BCH) on internet services.


The above combined with the fact that custodians don't like people **paying directly** for services from their wallet, and (imo) '*don't like*' is just the start... **The friction has to increase (inevitable imo) combined with the actual opportunity to use your coins**



It's a chicken and egg situation, **some people have to go first supporting those willing to either take BCH directly** or use services that accept BCH (former being the ultimate goal, but the latter is a start).


**So I believe a well curated list of services etc that accept BCH directly/indirectly would be a good start**


> I think it's due to level of sophistication that is needed to securely manage one's private keys. 



Given a truly low fee chain, one can experiment with just ~$1, making many tiny transactions **learning how things work** with minimal risk.


Can the average Joe learn? - I just watched an Orangutan on YT that had learned to drive a Golf Cart around a zoo... 


People are more capable than most think, sadly learned helplessness is a thing, would ancient scholars believe world literacy was possible at todays level?


The Bitcoin Dot Com wallet **used** to be easy to use (pre spam) and a good starting point. A decent wallet experience is certainly needed for those starting out (thanks Selene). 


Then build intuition about how things work with a couple of dollars on Electron Cash (desktop) for the intrepid.



> BIP39 was important step there long ago. But nothing significant happened since. Managing keys with Electon Cash or Selene on BCH is fundamentally the same as doing so on Electrum back in 2015 over unified Bitcoin chain - from operational security standpoint. 

The rise of hardware wallets has been a significant step for security in the interim.


The next step will be harnessing the secure enclave  on smartphones to act as hardware wallets. see Graphene OS's use of Titan M on pixels (not directly crypto related yet)




Perhaps the ability for my secure element to talk to yours, sending over my 'secrets' encrypted with **my** biometrics,  inaccessible to you but recoverable on 'standardised biometric hardware'. An Apple 'keychain' like solution shows the way.



> This is my perspective: while both operating coins and teaching willing people - **technical barrier is just too high**


Yep it's not easy, and as yet no clear path. The solution (for the masses) is probably technological,


But how do people start learning with traditional money, they are given a small amount at a young age and allowed to play, it can even be a walled garden where coins cannot be lost as they are encumbered with an overseer covenant (programmability ftw)


The path to full decentralisation is probably a lot longer than many would like.




> User DangerHighVoltage111 (now deleted for some reason) was responding to me in several threads about importance of p2p cash philosophy. And he created a thread with **a call to action of not listening to sirens, presumably myself included** - and to teach people

All voices are welcome, especially those who argue in good faith for or against BCH.


But even the rabid Trolls have their place, ~~under the bridge~~ keeping us grounded honing our point of view, and as we know 

* '*An infinite number of Trolls bangin away on their keyboards are bound to hit on something of value sooner or later*'. God bless em!


> education: as DangerHighVoltage111 called, I also call for teaching willing people whenever possible, maybe I am simply wrong about severity of key management problem and growth of network effect of BCH would take care of everything


Though I don't think 'key management' is the thing '*mainly*' holding BCH back, I would say it's still a big worry even for those who have been here a while. We all become complacent, backups backups (but not *TOO* many!), check your backups...



> uncensorable speech: there is tremendous unrealized value of uncensorable speech, potential to overlay all content on the Internet with built-in monetization and user-moderated rating system and commentary, serverless, as hashes on chain (BitTorrent seems the best fit) and well-thought UI unwrapping it: allowing users to bootstrap from zero, without DNS-dependence, locally follow and engage in monetization, donate to content providers. Something, that Memo fell short off, extremely unfortunately. I'm calling for smarter people than myself to develop it 

Yes, hopefully the next big thing in social media, a truly decentralised platform, we used to have a tipping bot around here and imo it was one of BCH's greatest ambassadors, but reddit stopped it from working afaik.


> (meanwhile, I need capital, and hopefully will have extra at some point - to sponsor it)


Good luck, 


u/Marc_De_Mesel single handedly supported just such a platform giving away countless BCH (big thanks to Marc and hope he is well)


> PoW, low fees, UTXO system and improvements in OP_RETURN make BCH the best posed open blockchain for this

The inherent scalability of the UTXO model (world scale throughput... TBC) combined with the richness of the scripting language (Cashtokens) truly opens the doors for **permissionless** p2p cash for the whole world.


The permissionless bit comes from the fact that **anybody** can **actually** build almost anything on top with such scripting capabilities **without having to petition the community or the Devs for a consensus change**

Did I pay this 5000+ sats fee by myself?,"Might be a stupid question.

Want to do p-2-p but don't want to do something stupid by accident and lose my security deposit on Bisq. Was forced to use an exchange.

I sent BTC from the exchange to a wallet.

An app in Watch-Only mode for that wallet shows ""Transaction Confirmed 2/6""

The amount sent from the exchange is $0.68 higher than the amount displayed as in possession on the watch-only wallet. This loss is just the network fee which I was already warned about. That's fine.

The problem is, before it said ""2/6 confirmations"", it said there was another fee of over 5000 sats, and that, in USD, is over 10% of the amount I had sent. Is that representative of the entire block being mined, so other senders online right now are sharing the burden of that 5000+ sats fee with me, and my share of the burden was only $0.68? Or have I lost 5000 sats from somewhere (the exchange, the receiver's wallet once we reach stage 6/6, something else?)

"Don't become complacent. ""The market"" will not decide to use p2p for you.","There is a dangerous notion going around that ""the market"" is just not ready for p2p cash and you should just lean back and do nothing and wait until ""the market"" or the people are ready. This notion is dangerous and completely misunderstands the nature of Bitcoin as p2p cash. It preys on your natural tendency of inaction.

Let me make a comparison. Everyone immediately understands the freedom that comes with your own car. But driving around in traffic, taking care of your car also involves a LOT of responsibility that you wouldn't have when someone else would do all this for you. That's why people use caps or busses. And yet while using them they still understand the freedom a self owned car brings. 

P2P cash is not a product that just needs a ready market like an Iphone. P2P cash is a freedom that comes with responsibility. We are in the stage where there are cars but no paved roads yet. Driving this care is difficult and the freedom still limited, yet all the responsibilities are there. To get over this hill, p2p cash needs to be taught. People need to understand the freedom that comes when you accept the responsibilities. And the roads need to be paved. 

If we sit back and do nothing, nothing will change. ""The market"" can print as many units as it wants to prop up false prophets that keeps you in the system without freedom forever. They prey on the greed of people to rather be rich than free. If people don't understand the freedom, safety and literal peace that comes with better, sound money, we won't get over that initial hill.

"Don't become complacent. ""The market"" will not decide to use p2p for you.","Most Americans will happily give up their property and freedom if you tell them the oligarchs want it. 

They won't accept Bitcoin Cash, because it's the freedom bitcoin. They don't want it. They want the one that's government and JP Morgan approved, because they're afraid. 

They're afraid to hold their own money. They're so easily scared out of holding 10,000 sats on their phone, like they got scared out of accepting $5 worth of bitcoin for a coffee.

Psychological: For humans, predicting Bitcoin’s future is impossible. Our knowledge is limited by our own experiences, and we can’t foresee the actions of other powerful entities. That makes it less of a science and more of a mystery game.

Price wise: I’ve got a feeling Bitcoin will swing up and down toward the 200k mark. At that point, the whales will decide whether to crush it or let it keep growing. As long as they don’t all dump their holdings, BTC will likely rebound. Many of them are already sitting on more than a 3x, so the game is in their hands. It’s pretty clear they’re the ones creating the waves—buying, selling, wiping out longs and shorts along the way. In the end, it’s all a gamble. I can imagine having BTC recessions 😂.",True,1,

The only way to find out the value of money is to (try and) spend it.,"This obviously relates to Bitcoin as well as traditional money.

But when I did have this thought last night, it wasn't primarily inspired by Bitcoin - it was because I need to purchase some imported equipment for construction, and I was thinking about how much I needed to spend on that, and how the value of my currency related to the value of the products I was going to buy.

And how prices - especially for construction materials - keep going up and up. 

We (society in general) have practically come to accept this inflation as ""normal"". Most people are resigned to thinking they can't do anything about this.

But we can.

Bitcoin came along to help us. To fix money.

And Bitcoin has already improved many peoples' lives (I'll skip those who stupidly gambled away fortunes against constant better advice not to invest more than they can safely lose).

Bottom line:

A Bitcoin that you can't spend on things you need, is useless, and you'll find that out when you need to spend, which we all need to do at some points in life.

Whitepaper also said quite succinctly: ""The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity."" Not coincidentally just like TCP/IP itself, which is a simple protocol that cares about getting a packet from A to B. Layers on top, like HTTP and SSL, do more complex tasks.

The amount of non-technical people blindly following the religion of BCH is... well, not surprising, considering how there's also a massive industry of shitcoins that could only exist with that same blindness.

Robustness. Security. This is what matters, and BTC's protocol is the right kind of ""good enough"" with the massive first mover network effect needed to maintain its security.

1. You must use a platform that lets you place a limit order on its order book (Coinbase Advanced, Kraken Pro, etc.)

2. You must place a ""buy"" limit order at a specific price. There are usually helper buttons that auto fill the current ""mid market"" price or select 1%, 2%, etc. over that price.

3. Usually you will get a fee discount if you place a ""post only"" limit order. This places your intent to buy on the order book and means you are a **maker**, which Exchanges like because it creates market liquidity. These orders get filled by **takers**, i.e. people who want the order to complete immediately and opt to pay a higher fee.

The big caveat here: if you're a maker, there's no guarantee you get your purchase. E.g. Bitcoin is $115,000 ""mid market"" and you put a post-only buy at $115,000.

"Qubic attack against Monero failed, now they move to target Doge instead","Qubic ran a miner-bribe attack that tried to incentivize Monero miners to mine against the interests of their network. (receiving payment in another token which was pumped to run a price-dumping scheme against XMR).

Qubic aimed to get 51% hashrate and announced that if they did, they were going to mine empty blocks on XMR, disrupting the reliable functioning of the network.

Although Qubic has not stopped mining XMR at this point, and their attack (mostly through FUD on social media) succeeded to damage the XMR price a little, XMR has remained noticeably resilient on the market.

Mining figures indicate that Qubic only seems to have reached about 34% of hashrate instead of > 50%.

After previously suspending Monero deposits, Kraken has re-opened to them, albeit with a crazy high confirmation threshold of 720 Monero blocks (about a day's worth of processing according to Kraken announcement screenshots).

I'll preface by saying i consider my self somewhat of a Bitcoin maxi. I run a node and a small miner, but I am fairly new to Bitcoin so forgive me if I'm missing some of the technical information.

I am trying to learn as much as I can about Bitcoin Ideally from both sides and I keep hearing this argument that Bitcoin has been ""captured"" and that it is doomed to never grow to function as a currency, and that ultimately when the mining supply dries up there will be no transaction fees to support mining.

I'd like to believe that if Bitcoin were ever in a place that the block size needed an increase or any other new development in order to grow to meet demand, that most people would vote in favor of these changes. 

Does anyone here truly believe that Bitcoin should never change or have a block size increase? Don't we all agree that Bitcoin should receive the necessary changes to grow with the world? I don't understand the need for BCH when Bitcoin always has the potential to grow to whatever block size or development change is necessary to make it function.

""We can always increase the blocksize"" is what smallblockers have been saying since 2014. We've heard it countless times, but in that timespan, BTC network has been congested several times, on occasion months at a time, with no action upon those ideals.

Then there is the disingenuous, irrational argumentation and goalpost-shifting from smallblockers evidenced during the blocksize wars, and the result is, there is simply no reason to believe that the argument is anything but hypothetical.

Read ""Hijacking Bitcoin"" if you want to know the full scope of this insincerity.

It led to BCH's creation, and since then there is simply no reason to increase the blocksize on BTC. If you want to have a working Bitcoin chain with SHA256 mining, high reliability, low per-transaction fees, and powerful scripting features, there is Bitcoin Cash.",True,25,

Several scenarios are possible as I can see it:

* p2p cash is just not as important as even Satoshi himself was expecting, market will continue current hybrid trend and crypto will only be used as a tool for savings. 21mln limit is the end-all-be-all of Satoshi's invention. Market continues to use centralize solutions for payments even after debt paradigm dies. BTC goes on, BCH slides down

* p2p cash would become much more important in the mid-term, but small blockers would continue to dominate vanguards in BTC. BTC may stall, BCH may gain. In a severe case BCH gain may cause BTC downspiral

* p2p cash would be such of importance that all people engaged with BTC would be convinced, and new vanguard will push small blockers aside. Including possible quick shift if it would be easily observable that BCH started to gain network effect because of p2p cash demand. BTC may gain much more. BCH slides
