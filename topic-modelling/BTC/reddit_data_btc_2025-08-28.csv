Best thing is to buy btc and hold because with buying you are forced to think that yours 5k/10k mining rig will give you btc forever.
You will be lucky getting what you spent,super lucky if you return even the electricity bill,if you buy a miner you should understand that you will have to sell it in few months and buying another better forever.

Buy a pool,buy mineral oil and put all miners in pool and then pair the pool with your house’s underfloor heating.you will have the house always warm in winter.

   However, there isn’t that much actual economic monies in that market cap. It’s probably in the billions. 
   Cashing out early movers of bitcoin is taking that perceived value, and converting it into real fiat currency. Aka if you bought 10 bitcoin for $10,000 back in 2014 and now you have $1,150,000.00 institutional companies can now create out of thin air $1,140,000 and take that in under assets.

september could be the reset bitcoin traders needed,"looking ahead to september, i think bitcoin’s market structure is finally stabilizing after months of messy chop. august was dominated by liquidations, forced selling, and macro headlines. but under the surface, the flows are shifting in a healthier way. spot inflows from etfs and direct purchases are still consistent. miner selling pressure has cooled after weeks of being a drag. open interest is reset lower, which takes some of the froth out of the system.

right now btc feels less overextended than it did back in july. we’re sitting at support levels that have been tested multiple times, and the derivatives curve is starting to look more neutral instead of over-levered. what matters most to me in september is whether the fed sticks to its softer language from jackson hole. a dovish stance tends to spill directly into bitcoin’s price because liquidity flows toward harder assets when real yields compress.

The question is whether you believe the “exit liquidity” theory (sell into their demand), or if this is just the start of a much bigger cycle where institutions drive BTC far higher than retail ever could.

Personally, I’m leaning toward holding longer. If companies are buying billions now, maybe the top is way further than we think.

Kinda like how WHITENET feels right now  still early, but when institutions notice its real-world asset angle, the upside could get wild.",True,1,

Bitcoin now makes up 1.7% of all global money... that's actually insane when you think about it,"Just saw this River analysis and had to share. Bitcoin hit 1.7% of global money supply when we peaked at $2.4T market cap earlier this month. They're counting all major fiat currencies ($112.9T) plus gold and other hard money ($25.1T) in that calculation.

We're sitting around $2.29T now so closer to 1.66%, but still... in 16 years we went from literally nothing to nearly 2% of ALL money on earth. That includes every dollar, euro, yen, pound, plus gold reserves.

The Fed stuff is interesting too\*\*:\*\*  
Powell basically confirmed rate cuts are coming at Jackson Hole on Friday. Bitcoin jumped 2% right after his speech and hit $116,000. CME data shows 75% of investors expect a 25 basis point cut in September.

Here's what gets me though - central banks keep printing more fiat while Bitcoin's supply stays fixed. Every time they fire up the money printer, our slice of the pie gets bigger just by existing. We don't even have to do anything.

Gold and Bitcoin are basically eating the lunch of every fiat currency right now. The purchasing power destruction is real and people are waking up to it.

Pretty wild that something that started as a whitepaper is now competing with currencies that took centuries to establish. Makes you wonder what 5% or 10% looks like if this trend continues.

If you're riding this wave and taking profits along the way, just remember to track everything properly. Tools like awaken.tax become more important as Bitcoin's share of global money keeps growing and the tax implications get more complex.

Anyone else think we're still early at under 2%? Or are we getting ahead of ourselves here?",False,81,

How so?

Keeping in mind this: 

* https://jlopp.github.io/unspendable-utxo-calculator

* https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/mining/block-reward

BTC block can fit 4.4k P2PKH 1-to-2 UTXOs currently. Let's say feerate would stay at 1sat/byte long-term: if, like right now, market solves congestions not with fee bidding, but with delaying, custodianship or use of other chains. 225 bytes each UTXO, ~0.01 BTC per filled block

So, if chain usage just stays the same dynamically, then ~50:50 reward to fees ratio in 2056 and ~90:10 in 2072, and smooth sail to ~100:0 in 2100s

btc max price,"Hello everyone,

I've been playing around with some numbers and wanted to share the idea (maybe someone will correct me if I'm wrong).

If we think of a scenario where BTC was the only global money, we can use the equation of exchange:

M \times V = P \times Y

Where:

 = money in circulation (BTC × price).

 = velocity of money (how many times it rotates per year).

 = World nominal GDP.


Global nominal GDP today is around USD 113–114 trillion (IMF 2025).

 The useful supply of BTC is ~18 million (discounting those that have been lost).

So, solving:

\text{BTC Price} = \frac{GDP\_{\text{world}}}{V \times 18,000,000}

If we take typical values ​​of (between 3 and 6), it gives us a range:

V = 3 → ~2.1M USD/BTC

V = 4 → ~1.6M USD/BTC

V = 5 → ~1.3M USD/BTC

V = 6 → ~1.0 M USD/BTC


That is, for BTC to cover the global money function and “replicate” the current money supply, it would need a value in the range of ~1–2 million USD per BTC (perhaps up to 3–4 million if we use a lower money velocity or consider lost BTC).

Obviously, this calculation is theoretical and simplified:

It does not contemplate future GDP growth.

It does not contemplate that States will continue printing fiat currency in the meantime → therefore the “equilibrium price” would move higher over time.

It also does not consider strategic reserves, savings, immobilized BTC, or credit dynamics that could modify the speed.


The intention is to have a more or less well-founded idea of ​​what the BTC ceiling may be until it stabilizes and enters a stage of slow delation that makes it more useful as cash and not so much as a speculative asset or reserve of value.

Does this reasoning make sense or am I missing something key?",False,0,

"Binance froze my funds for 30 days, then sent my withdrawal to the wrong address and blamed it on malware 🤡","I need to share what just happened because it’s absolutely insane and people should know how Binance treats its users.

Binance opened a bogus $197 “dispute” against me and froze ALL my funds for 30 days straight. Every single day I was threatened — my account would be suspended, closed, or funds withheld unless I paid.

After the 30 days expired, they closed the case themselves without my compliance. Fine, I thought, finally done.

I go to withdraw \~$2,300 BTC to my whitelisted Trezor address — the one I had saved long ago. I didn’t type anything, didn’t paste anything, just clicked the dropdown.

Guess what? Binance sends my money to a completely different Bitcoin address that is NOT mine. When I confronted them, they had the audacity to blame it on “malware” on my device. 🤦‍♂️

Here’s the kicker: their own system behavior proves that’s impossible. If the address had been tampered with locally, Binance’s backend would’ve flagged it as a new address and forced network selection + 2FA. That never happened. They admitted themselves that the transaction was processed as whitelisted. Which means the mistake was inside Binance, not on my machine.

So after 30 days of threats and frozen funds, my very next withdrawal gets “misrouted” to a random address, and they blame me. This isn’t an accident anymore — it looks like retaliation for not bowing to their $197 shakedown.

I have the blockchain records, I have the screenshots of their UI logic, I have the chat transcripts where they basically admit it went through as whitelisted.

This company is a predatory custodian that overrides its own security guarantees when it suits them. If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone. And the fact that they’re hiding behind “malware” excuses while bypassing their billion-dollar whitelist infrastructure is beyond laughable.

People really need to think twice before leaving any serious money on Binance.

Marching With the Band,"I mean, he's probably ""privy"" to the plan (project 2025) that's in motion and knows that the devaluation of our currency is already snowballing, what with this asshole and his friends pushing it along. Yeah, BTC will be 1m dollars, but that single bitcoin won't even buy you a trailer in even the methiest of trailer parks. BTC isn't going up! The US $$$ is going down

Now, obviously massive devaluation of the US dollar (like we are *currently* seeing) is going to be worse than a bull in a china shop, it'll be a little kid in the Eastern Diamondback Rattler store.

Then viola! The billionaires debts are worthless, and even though their money is also worth less, everyone else will be even worse off, and isn't that really what this whole billionaire thing is? These people aren't happy with riches unless someone else has less as a result. They want *relative wealth*. Seriously, had our nation just stopped electing republicans after Nixon (actually pretty progressive for a R), and we had a series of progressive leaders, *these billionaires would be substantially richer,* probably exponentially so.

But it wouldn't be as big of a gap between that wealth and the bottom of the pyramid (suspiciously so) shaped economic system' wealth.

There are plenty of phrases and idioms that are appropriate here, so I'm just going to reiterate the one that (IMO) the most people need to get this through their (between 3.7 × 10\^17 kg/m³ - 6 × 10\^17 kg/m³) skulls.

These people would rather be kings of a wasteland than citizens of a literal utopia.

And they are playing with fire. So many people have lost so much,  we aren't even a year in. Every villain knows you don't take everything from a man, because then you've given him nothing to lose.

No billionaire alive today has ever learned that lesson, *actually had to learn it*, outside of history or literature.

CoinBase ceo brian armstrong says bitcoin could hit $1m by 2030... why its pure and utter overestimation?,"so coinbase's ceo just said bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2030. that's roughly 8x from current levels in about 5 years. sounds wild but let me walk through why this might actually happen.

the math behind it:

bitcoin would need to average about 45% annual gains to hit $1m by 2030. historically, btc has averaged way higher returns over multi-year periods, so the percentage isn't impossible.

but here's what would need to happen:

institutional adoption at scale we're already seeing companies like bitmine accumulating massive eth positions. if similar moves happen with bitcoin at the corporate treasury level, that's a lot of supply getting locked up.

government and sovereign adoption countries are starting to add bitcoin to reserves. if major economies follow el salvador's lead, demand could explode while supply stays fixed at 21 million coins.

currency debasement continues with central banks trapped by government debt (keeping rates artificially low), traditional currencies keep losing purchasing power. bitcoin becomes more attractive as digital gold.

why armstrong might be onto something:

coinbase sees institutional demand that retail doesn't

they see the actual money flows happening behind the scenes

their business only works if crypto succeeds, so they're motivated to be realistic

bitcoin's fixed supply becomes more obvious as more people want it

why he might be wrong:

regulatory crackdowns could stunt growth

competing cryptocurrencies could eat bitcoin's market share

technical issues or security problems could derail adoption

economic crashes typically hit risk assets hardest

my take:

$1m sounds nuts until you remember we just went from $15k to $124k in less than 3 years. that's already an 8x move in a shorter timeframe.

the real question isn't whether bitcoin can 8x again - it's whether the stuff that got us here (money printing, institutions buying, currencies getting weaker) keeps happening for another 5 years.

if central banks stay trapped by debt and keep rates low while governments keep spending, armstrong's prediction might actually be conservative.

what this means for coinbase users:

whether you believe the $1m target or not, coinbase is clearly positioning for massive growth. they're building infrastructure assuming crypto gets way bigger than it is today.

Indeed, it isn't impossible in the sense that the probability of it happening is not exact zero.

That said, let's check the plot of averaged annualized returns of BTC. We can easily see that the average annualized logarithmic returns over four-year periods were around 103% in 2016. As opposed to that, in 2023, the annualized average logarithmic returns over four-year periods were around 37%. Moreover, the annualized average logarithmic returns were quite steadily decreasing during the 2016-2023 period.

are we looking at a bitcoin cycle top in the next 2-3 months?,"glassnode just dropped some analysis that has me thinking about where we are in this cycle. the data is pointing to bitcoin being in a historically late phase right now.

the numbers:

bitcoin went from $15,500 in november 2022 to $124,500 last week - that's a 700% rally. when you compare this timing to previous cycles, we're apparently about 2-3 months away from where past cycle tops occurred.

currently 91% of all bitcoin is in profit and has been above the +1 standard deviation band for 273 days. that's the second longest stretch on record, only behind the 2015-2018 cycle that hit 335 days.

profit taking patterns:

long-term holders (people who held for 155+ days) have been taking profits at levels comparable to previous euphoric phases. this kind of selling pressure typically happens near cycle tops.

rekt capital says if bitcoin follows historical halving cycles, the peak would be mid-september to mid-october 2025. that's literally 1-2 months away.

current price action:

bitcoin got rejected at $114,000 yesterday after bouncing from $112,000 support. if we lose that $110,000-$112,000 zone, analysts are saying we could drop back into the $90,000-$100,000 range pretty quickly.

what this means:

look, nobody knows exactly when tops happen until after they're done. but when you have:

700% gains from cycle lows

91% of supply in profit for 273 days straight

long-term holders selling at euphoric levels

price getting rejected at key resistance

it starts looking like we might be closer to the end than the beginning of this run.

my take:

this doesn't mean bitcoin crashes tomorrow. we could still push higher and extend this cycle. but the risk/reward is definitely shifting. if you've been riding this from the lows, maybe consider taking some profits. if you are taking profits, make sure you're tracking everything properly for tax season. tools like awaken.tax can help you stay on top of the reporting side while you focus on the trading decisions.

the $110,000-$112,000 zone is probably make or break right now. hold that and we might get another push higher. lose it and things could get interesting fast.
