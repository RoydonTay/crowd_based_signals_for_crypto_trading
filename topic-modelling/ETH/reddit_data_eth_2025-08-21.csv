Any ways to get a small amount of free ETH?,"Now, im not a bottom feeder. But i have $20 worth of Fet (an eth based crypto I got awhile back) and want to sell it.

Now it says: Gas fee of  0.00003 ETH is needed.

Any way I can get this ETH without plugging in my card?",False,0,
Any ways to get a small amount of free ETH?,"no.

oh wait. 

  
1. **ETH Faucets**

These are websites that give out **very small amounts of ETH** (usually enough for gas) for free. Most require a crypto wallet address, sometimes a social media login. Examples:

* [faucet.metamask.io]() – Only works on Goerli or Sepolia testnets, not mainnet (good for testing, not spending).
* [Alchemy Goerli Faucet]() – Again, testnet ETH only.

⚠ **Important:** These give **testnet ETH**, not real ETH. If you want to move your FET to sell it, testnet ETH won’t work. Real ETH is needed for mainnet transactions.

# 2. Ask someone for a micro ETH transfer

If you have friends in crypto, sending **0.00003 ETH** is trivial. That’s about **$0.05 USD**—very cheap for someone to send.

# 3. Use a decentralized exchange that covers gas

Some DEXs (like certain bridges) allow you to sell tokens **without ETH**, but usually they:

* Swap your token for **another token that can pay gas** (rare for $20 FET).
* Or they have **“meta transactions”**, which pay the gas for you—but these are uncommon.

# 4. Convert FET via a centralized exchange

If you can send FET to **Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.**, you can sell it without worrying about tiny ETH for gas:

* On centralized exchanges, you don’t need ETH for gas.
* Then you can withdraw USD/AUD directly.

💡 **Bottom line:** For $20 of FET, the easiest option is to **send it to a centralized exchange and sell it there**.

BitMine Expands ETH Treasury to $6.6B Despite Stock Decline,"BitMine Immersion Technologies has boosted its Ethereum holdings, adding 373,000 ETH last week and bringing its total to 1.52 million tokens valued at $6.6 billion. This comes as institutional interest in Ethereum grows, although the company’s share price has dropped 14.2% since August 11, according to Google Finance.  
  
Chairman Thomas Lee said the company’s accumulation plan, known as the “alchemy of 5%,” is aimed at securing 5% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. A spokesperson added that Ethereum is being positioned as the backbone of modern financial systems and the token economy being shaped by AI. With exchanges like bitget recently giving European buyers more direct access to ETH cutting of 50% of the price, it’s not surprising that I’ve also been considering picking some up myself.  
  
With 1.3% of all Ether in circulation, BitMine is currently the largest corporate holder. SharpLink Gaming follows with 729,000 ETH worth $3.2 billion, while The Ether Machine holds 345,000 ETH worth about $1.5 billion.  
  
In recent months, both BitMine and SharpLink have accelerated their ETH buying. BitMine has outlined a plan to raise $24.5 billion through a stock sale for further acquisitions, while SharpLink raised $389 million to expand its position.",False,17,

What is the difference between Causevest Coin and Ethereum Coin Supply flows,"Eth does not have a fixed supply

• ETH is printed to reward validators for block generation or finality generation

• ETH is destroyed when people pay the basefee to get transactions into a block (EIP-1559 mechanism)

• This makes the ETH supply non-deterministic (it depends on the amount of stakers vs the demand for blockspace) The total supply can go up or down depending on these factors.

XCV has a predictable long term supply

• XCV has an initial total supply (the amount in all genesis UTXOs + seeded in all pools/pots at genesis)

• This value never changes numerically as the “total supply” or sum over all UTXO balances + pool balances is always the same as genesis.

• XCV also has a basefee system for transactions, but these coins flow into the Network Income Pool and are redistributed throughout the network. It never changes the total supply number",False,3,

**BitMine jumps from zero to first place with record speed**

Tom Lee, who serves as the Chairman of BitMine’s Board and is widely known from Fundstrat, said the team moved fast for a reason. “BitMine moved with lightning speed in its pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH..

Tom added that what makes BitMine stand out is how quickly it raised crypto NAV per share and how liquid the company’s stock has become.

Meanwhile, over the last five days, the average daily trading volume of BitMine’s stock has hit $1.6 billion, ranking the company 42nd among all 5,704 U.S.-listed stocks, just behind Uber Technologies, based on Fundstrat’s breakdown of Statista data.

Taking 35K USD loan for ETH,"Horrible idea. You are taking on debt with likely 10 to 15 percent APR, and even the lowest loan rates today are around 8 percent unless you are borrowing from family. That interest alone will eat into any gains. On top of that, if you sell your ETH later, taxes will crush you since all gains are taxable. You will be stuck with both the loan payments and a tax bill. Ethereum is not going to 8,400 dollars in a year, if it ever does. 

Realistically it may take 5 to 10 years, and by then the loan interest will have destroyed any upside if paying 2.5k a month. Totally not worth the risk.

Taking 35K USD loan for ETH,"If you have 20K or more, best option is to open a Interactive brokers account (IBKR Pro) and request a margin account.   You would have around 75k to borrow at 5% interest.  Your purchases must be timed right at stock or crypto low price and you must sell on a 20% or better gain.  Then carefully repeat.  I personally started with 100k in 2021, got torn to shreds in 2022 but recovered in 2023.  Now combined accounts over 1.4 million.  My best purchase was NVIDIA in 2021 and now ETHU April 9th 2025 when ETH dropped to $1,400.  ETHU is double Leveraged to ETH.  I borrowed 27k to buy a Leveraged ETF   🤪 Up 475% since.

Taking 35K USD loan for ETH,"Do it now
It was just 4800 a few days ago
Maybe macroeconomic bullshit will drive it down slightly
Who knows
I suggest putting all that money on ether
Putting it on metamask
Go to gmx.io
And buy a LOW leverage perpetual future on ether
Like 3x leverage
You have the option of up to 100x
Don’t fall for it you’ll just get liquidated 
3x could handle a price drop to like $1500 
If it gets ugly just get your hands on some more money and add to the collateral, thereby decreasing the leverage and lowering the liquidation price.
But I think the odds of ether going to $1500 is about 1 in a billion right now

I'd say 10k is unlikely, but possible. I think 8k is more likely.

I was lucky to get in this year at a DCA of 1700. But I am planning to sell this year as well, as I believe a bear market will follow in the months after ATH's.

I'm going to be DCA'ing out. Meaning for example, I'll sell some at 7k, sell some at 8k, sell some at 9k, plan to sell the rest at 10k, but if it never hits 10k then I HODL the rest.

I've been watching and playing the crypto market since 2020, and it's just so risky man. It's mostly just psychology though. Most people see prices rising high, get excited or FOMO, and buy. Then they see prices bottom, get scared and sell. I'm proud of myself for doing the opposite this year, granite, my eth's not liquid yet, but soon to be.",True,3,

I ran it as a directory sub for years directing people to r/ethereum and other ethereum based subreddits when they landed on r/eth. Then a while ago I switched it to more of a general sub.

Now I’ve figured out a great use for the sub, I was thinking since the name of the r/eth sub is eth and that’s literally the ticker of ethereum we could do some cool things between r/eth and r/ethereum. I know price & trading discussion isn’t allowed on r/ethereum so maybe price and trading discussion could be allowed on the r/eth sub and all trading/price discussion between the 2 subs could happen on r/eth? And the r/eth sub could maybe be integrated in some cool way with r/ethereum to make it all work seamlessly.

Advice/opinion welcome,"That really comes down to your risk profile. Bitcoin is the safest bet when it comes to crypto. Ethereum is more of a play on tokenization, which is very likely to become a major trend, so the odds look better than with Bittensor and the long-term upside is bigger than Bitcoin. Bittensor, on the other hand, is a moonshot. It could take off, or it could crash and burn. If it takes off, you stand to make a lot; if it fails, you lose your monthly contribution.

So if you’re treating that €150–200 as pure play money, I’d put it into Bittensor for the chance of exponential gains. But if you’re serious about building savings, Bitcoin is the safer choice — or Ethereum if you want to take on a bit more risk.",True,1,

"Eth just broke 4.4k, What to expect next","NFA 
Just personal observation for your inference 

5k in-bound 
——————
- 1T MC 10K per Eth by EOY is plausible 70/30 odds skew positive outlook 

👉Expect a slight pull back to 2.8-3k after major pump to 5k+ new ATH (1-2 months consolidation before peak euphoria) 

- ETH Treasury companies creating new financial products to back infrastructure and multi-leverage with RWA is a foreseeable future 

- Build on #ETH/@Polkadot/@solana -> bridge liquidity and infrastructure to BTC until miners exhaustion and sell pressure due to  not being able to hedge electricity cost (15-20 years black swan) 

‼️ 2008 like housing crisis risk in fruition = potential 50-70% retrace during crypto winter  

✅Long-term thesis stays the same 5-10 years steady above 1T MC is plausible = Multi-Angle incentives to keep the liquidity pool deep as a stable bridge to other chain of cheaper entry+easier interoperability e.g @Polkadot 

- This could very well be the last time ever we’ll see this price range before next crypto winter 2026 (3k-5k new floor)

Understanding about ETHT price (2x leveraged ETF on ETH price),"I'm not sure how to comprehend this fact, but back in Dec 6, 2024, the ProShares Ultra Ether ETF (ticker: ETHT) price was $170.10, while ETH future at the time was $4095 and ETH price was around $4005. Now, the ETH future was $4319 and ETH price was $4296.55 (at this moment), but the ETHT price was nowhere close to $170.10 ---> I wonder what the reason is? Because there should be an almost perfect correlation of 1.0 between ETHT price and ETH future price. Or is this ETF a scam?

Understanding about ETHT price (2x leveraged ETF on ETH price),"The summary says “Seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times (2x) the daily performance of the Bloomberg Ethereum Index.”

Understanding about ETHT price (2x leveraged ETF on ETH price),"Leveraged ETFs don’t track the long-term price of the asset exactly. They’re designed to give 2× the daily move, not the total move over months.

For example, if I am an ETF that dropped from $100 to $90, it would be a 10% decrease. To go back to $100 from $90 I would need a 11% increase.

Now if that ETF was 2X leveraged, from $100 to $80 would be 20% decrease. From $80 to $100 would require a 25% increase.

Thinking that ethereum could reach 10k it is quite tentative to do a movement like this.

ETH Breakout: Is Altseason Officially Here?,"Looking at the recent performance of Ethereum (ETH), it's hard to ignore the significant upward trend! ETH is at $3,840.92 at the time of writing,  a remarkable 18.8% increase over the last year (1Y). More importantly, the current price is a strong breakout from what looked like a period of consolidation and even a dip around March-May.

This kind of strong upward movement in Ethereum is often a key indicator for the broader altcoin market. Historically, ETH has acted as a bellwether for ""Altseason"" – a period where many alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) experience substantial gains, often outperforming Bitcoin and even Ethereum itself.

**Why is ETH's breakout relevant to Altseason?**
 **Increased Confidence:** A strong ETH signals renewed investor confidence in the smart contract platform that underpins a vast majority of altcoins, including DeFi, NFTs, and various dApps.
 **Capital Rotation:** As ETH gains momentum, profits from ETH holdings often rotate into smaller-cap altcoins, fueling their price appreciation.
 **Ecosystem Health:** ETH's strength reflects the overall health and adoption of its ecosystem, which directly benefits projects built on Ethereum.

While past performance is not indicative of future results, this strong ETH breakout definitely has the crypto community buzzing about a potential Altseason. Keep an eye on your favorite altcoins – the tide might be turning!

Ten Years of Improving Ethereum: Key EIPs,"Here are the key Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that have significantly impacted Ethereum's development over its first decade:

* **EIP-20: Token Standard** (Adopted in 2017) : This EIP created the universal ERC-20 token standard, which streamlined token integration and catalyzed the ICO craze.
* **EIP-1559: Fee Markets** (Adopted in August 2021) : This proposal reformed Ethereum's fee market by introducing a dynamic ""base"" gas fee that is burned and an optional ""tip"" for validators, aiming to incentivize deflation and improve user experience.
* **EIP-3675: Proof-of-Stake** (also known as ""The Merge"") : This EIP replaced Ethereum's proof-of-work (PoW) with proof-of-stake (PoS), drastically reducing energy consumption and transforming ETH into a productive asset.
* **EIP-4844: L2 Blobs** (Implemented in March 2024) : This EIP introduced temporary storage space (""blobs"") for Layer 2 (L2) transaction data, significantly lowering L2 transaction costs and migrating much of Ethereum's activity to L2s.
* **EIP-3074: Wallet UX** (Merged in May 2025) : This proposal overhauled wallet functionality by giving externally owned accounts (EOAs) smart contract-like capabilities, enabling features like one-click approvals and gasless transactions to simplify the onchain experience.

These EIPs collectively shaped Ethereum into a constantly transforming ""living, breathing machine"" dedicated to providing decentralized compute.

ChangeNow.io Frozen My Funds - $550K. Beware of this Platform so you wont be sharing your story like I'm,"Hey Eth Community...  
honestly, i didn’t wanna have to post this but i’m kinda outta options at this point.

i used changenow a few months back to swap around $550K worth of crypto. things looked smooth at first, but right after the transaction, they asked me for full KYC, ID, source of funds, the whole deal. i gave them everything they asked for. this was back in march.

now it’s been 4 months. still no update. no refund. no answers. just complete silence.

i did some digging after things started feeling off and realized changenow is linked to changelly, and apparently they’ve had a bunch of people saying the same thing happened to them. then there’s atomic wallet (same devs, i think?) that got hacked for $100M last year some ppl even think it was an inside job. Guarda also keeps promoting changenow as a trusted partner, even with all these red flags.

what really stings is that i tried everything reached out politely, followed their public instructions, even DMed them after they told me to. but no one got back. some of my posts got deleted too. i kept hoping for a fair outcome... but nothing.

i’m not here to attack anyone, i’m just genuinely stuck and hurting. that was life-changing money. and it’s just... gone.

Heads up community, i wouldn’t wish this on anyone.

Idea! How to solve ETH gas problem,"Many people complain about the ETH gas fees and that it is holding ETH down. 

The issue is that the low transactions pay the same fee as the big transactions. In terms of percentage its a big % for the small transaction and a tiny % for the big transaction. 

Based on the data ETH has, why dont they find out how often the small and the big transactions occur see what they can do to solve this problem? 

For example they can decrease the gas fees on the small transactions and increase it on the big transactions. In the short term they will lose money when the small transactions occur, but when the big transactions occur they will recover the losses. 

They should work around with the data and fine the Equilibrium where they dont lose money long term and make all the customers happy. 
I am sure the people who make 10k transfers wont be bothered with 10$ fees, and 100k+ transfers wont be bothered with 100$ fees. That extra charge can compensate some of the discounts given for the small transactions.  ",False,0,

Sold ETH at 3000!,"*Used AI to reframe my post*

I recently made a move in crypto and wanted to share my experience and get some thoughts. Around 4–5 months ago, I bought my first Ethereum coin (1 ETH) at $2,560. At the time, I was just getting into investing—this year is actually my first year seriously exploring the stock market and crypto. I’m relatively young and generally believe in long-term investing, so I wasn’t planning on selling anytime soon.

That said, my ETH purchase was kind of impulsive. I saw the price drop and jumped in without too much analysis. When it fell further to around $1,500, I was obviously disappointed, but I wasn’t panicking—I had used extra money that I didn’t urgently need, so I was mentally prepared to hold for the long term, even 5+ years if necessary.

However, when the price climbed back up and hit $3,000 recently, I decided to sell 75% of my position. My thinking was that I could potentially re-enter if the price dips again in the future. It wasn’t a panic sell—more of a calculated exit—but now I’m wondering if it was the right call.

Would love to hear your opinions. Also, sorry if this post seems a bit noob-ish—just trying to learn as I go!

Ethereum Benefits in Future Update of ZOND, QRL's First Quantum Currency.

1. **Quantum-Resistant Security** ZOND QRL is designed with post-quantum cryptography at its core. This provides a high level of protection against future quantum computing threats. As Ethereum continues to grow in value and importance, collaboration or integration with quantum-resistant technologies like ZOND could help safeguard user assets in the long term.
2. **Cross-Chain Interoperability** The ZOND update improves communication capabilities with other blockchain networks, including Ethereum. This creates opportunities for secure cross-chain bridges and decentralized applications that can interact safely between both ecosystems.
3. **Advanced Smart Contract Capabilities** ZOND introduces a new layer of smart contract functionality that can serve as a secure environment for quantum-safe applications. Ethereum developers interested in post-quantum security may benefit from using or building on ZOND as an added layer of protection.
4. **Decentralization and Governance Synergy** Both Ethereum and QRL value decentralized governance. The ZOND update strengthens community-driven decision-making, providing a governance model that can inspire or collaborate with Ethereum-based DAOs.
5. **Developer Collaboration and Innovation** The upgrade creates new opportunities for developers from both communities to work together on building quantum-secure solutions, interoperability tools, and hybrid dApps that leverage the strengths of both blockchains.
6. **Future-Proofing the Ecosystem** By adopting quantum-resistant infrastructure now, ZOND QRL helps raise awareness in the broader crypto space—including Ethereum—about the importance of preparing for quantum threats. This benefits the entire blockchain community by encouraging proactive security development.
7. **With the launch of ZOND, the QRL quantumcurrency will be listed on major Tier 1 exchanges.**

# QRL Zond – The Upgrade Ethereum Needs for the Post-Quantum Era

The Ethereum community has always led the charge in blockchain innovation: smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs – all born from a bold and visionary ecosystem. But a new era is approaching – the **era of quantum computing**, which poses a real threat to the cryptographic foundations that blockchains like Ethereum rely on.

Enter **QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger)** with its groundbreaking **Zond upgrade** – the world’s first **post-quantum, EVM-compatible chain**. This is where Ethereum’s community should pay close attention — not to see QRL as a competitor, but as a **critical ally**.

# What Does Zond Change?

1. **Quantum Resistance Built In** Zond uses quantum-resistant cryptography (XMSS), protecting against quantum threats *today* — not in theory, but in practice. Ethereum, as powerful as it is, still relies on ECDSA – an algorithm that *will* be vulnerable to quantum attacks.
2. **Full EVM Compatibility** Zond allows smart contracts written for Ethereum to run seamlessly. Developers from the Ethereum ecosystem can build on Zond using the same tools they already know — but now with post-quantum security.
3. **Future-Proof Infrastructure** QRL isn’t just preparing for the future — it’s **building** it. With Zond, any Ethereum project can instantly gain quantum resistance without sacrificing flexibility or familiarity.

# Why Ethereum and QRL Should Move Forward Together

Ethereum is the most dominant force in Web3. But with dominance comes the responsibility to **secure the foundation**. This is where QRL steps in — as a shield, a bridge, and a partner.

By investing in QRL, the Ethereum community is not just diversifying — it's **future-proofing**. It's supporting innovation that *enhances* Ethereum’s reach and resilience.

# What Can You Do Today?

* **Deploy** a smart contract on Zond — porting from Ethereum takes minutes.
* **Consider** allocating part of your ETH portfolio into QRL — as a strategic hedge.
* **Learn** more about quantum-resistant cryptography — because the future is approaching fast.

**QRL Zond isn’t an alternative to Ethereum — it’s an enhancement.**  
It’s the quantum-resistant infrastructure Ethereum doesn’t yet have — but absolutely will need.",False,4,
"The First created quantumcurrency appreciated by the largest defense corporation in the world - Lockheed Martin, will cooperate with Ethereum","This is a compelling development that Ethereum folks shouldn’t overlook.

QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger) was built from the ground up with quantum resistance in mind - unlike most other chains, which are now trying to retrofit that protection. With the Zond upgrade, QRL becomes the first EVM-compatible, post-quantum secure blockchain, meaning Ethereum developers can port smart contracts over with little to no friction while gaining quantum resistance from day one.

The timing is important. NIST has already selected post-quantum algorithms for standardization, and nation-state interest in quantum computing (like China's) is not slowing down. Projects like QRL have been preparing for this moment for years.

Seeking Advice: Securely Withdrawing ETH from an Old Smart Contract (Avoiding Front-Running),"Back in 2019, my brother created a learning project and sent me 2 ETH, locking it in a simple Solidity smart contract as a kind of ""puzzle vault.""

The purpose was educational. The contract uses a passphrase mechanism and a unlock condition:

**Unlocking Conditions:**

To successfully withdraw the ETH, the caller must:

1. Know the original passphrase (which I do), and
2. Send at least twice the contract's current ETH balance in the same transaction.

Here’s the contract for reference:

    pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
    
    contract HiddenVault {
        bytes32 private hashedSecret;
    
        constructor(bytes32 _hashedSecret) public payable {
            hashedSecret = _hashedSecret;
        }
    
        function unlock(bytes memory passphrase) public payable {
            uint256 vaultBalance = address(this).balance - msg.value;
            require(msg.value >= vaultBalance * 2, ""Insufficient collateral"");
            require(sha256(passphrase) == hashedSecret, ""Wrong passphrase"");
            selfdestruct(msg.sender);
        }
    }

**My Concern:**

The current balance is 2 ETH, so to meet the contract’s conditions I would need to send 4 ETH in the same transaction. If successful, the contract would self-destruct and transfer the total (6 ETH) to the caller (me), per its logic.

**Questions:**

1. Is Flashbots Protect RPC the best approach to prevent this kind of front-running?
3. How risk is do execute this contract? Can I be 100% sure I wont lose any eth?
3. Has anyone handled similar unlock patterns recently? I’d appreciate any advice on gas settings, transaction bundles, or examples.",False,2,

Tom Lee’s Investment Thesis,"Lee’s thesis is that large banks like JPM and BofA will issue stablecoins and buy ETH to stake. Doesn’t this diminish the point of decentralization? Isn’t that the primary benefit that Ethereum has clung too over the years?

He said nothing about increased fee revenue, likely because L2s efficiency gains will offset the increased volume. Ethereum’s network usage (mainnet) has declined in 2025, leading to lower transaction volumes and gas fees. For example, in March 2025, the daily burn volume hit an all-time low of 53.07 ETH.

Can someone explain to me what will drive value if increased usage, primarily on L2s, won’t drive significant fee revenue? 

Banks accumulating and staking ETH would impact supply and demand dynamics but at the cost of decentralization. Additionally banks staking large amounts of ETH to secure the network for their stablecoins would reduce the yield for staking ETH. Is Lee’s thesis sound?

I’m not questioning ETH’s value as a technology, I think it will be widely adopted. But, I don’t see its adoption significantly driving price appreciation.

I would be interested in anyone’s thoughts on this, especially if you disagree.",False,1,
"[ discussion ] Is it realistic for ETH at ~$2500 to reach $5000 this year, considering macro and BTC dominance?","Hi everyone,

I’m not new to crypto, but I don’t do deep technical analysis and mostly follow news, macro trends, and Bitcoin dominance to guide my ETH decisions.

ETH is around $2500 now, and I’m considering adding to my position. I’m trying to understand if it’s realistic for ETH to reach ~$5000 within this year or if that’s too optimistic.

I’ve seen discussions about potential ETH ETFs, Bitcoin dominance possibly dropping, and the possibility of an altcoin season that could push ETH and other alts higher if BTC stabilizes or slows down. I’m also keeping an eye on the Fed, inflation data, and rate cuts, as these could influence liquidity and risk appetite for crypto.

On the other hand, I’ve heard some people mention a possible recession next year, which might impact markets or delay any strong crypto rally. I’m trying to understand how much these macro factors and BTC dominance shifts realistically influence ETH’s price in a year timeframe.

For those actively tracking ETH and market cycles, do you think a 2x this year for ETH is possible if we get a good macro environment, or is it better to have lower expectations and continue steady accumulation without hoping for a big rally?

Not looking for financial advice, just curious about your perspectives and what you’re watching this year for ETH.
