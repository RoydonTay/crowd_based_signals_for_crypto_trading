Saw some slander about p2e games on ethereum,"So I came across some slander on here about p2e games, and I’m kinda curious where everyone stands on it. From my perspective, they’re actually pretty solid, just another way of having fun for some people. Not every game needs to fit the same mold, right? Some folks enjoy grinding for loot in traditional games, others enjoy earning a bit of value while they play. Doesn’t mean one’s “better” than the other.

But I keep noticing the community seems split 50/50 on whether P2E is the future or just some gimmick. Why do you think it’s got such a bad rep in Ethereum circles? Is it because of scammy projects that left a sour taste, or something deeper about the model itself? It's a 13B industry, and gaming is a 2T industry. Why not get in?

Why would you stake?,"Been gathering information on staking from every source imaginable and I still cant wrap my head on why anyone would stake. Im hoping someone can chime in and change my mind. But the most common answer...

""if you're in it for the long run""

That answer just blows my mind. Why in gods name would you lock up funds on potentially volatile asset?

Just look at eth this month alone. If you bought eth at 4k and staked, your locked in and getting a few dollars (if that) every few days. Then as you all know eth reaches 4900 an ATH! Well it doesn't matter cuz you cant sell. But if u were unstaked, you could sell, take profits and reenter where it is today at 4300 and still be in the green. ",False,3,
Why would you stake?,Some of us aren’t in and out. We are holding long term. That’s it. What’s hard to get?,True,12,
Why would you stake?,You must be new to this kind of lifestyle,True,5,
Why would you stake?,Idk why you’re shitting on it. “What lifestyle is that? Losing?” Some people have more than a thousand dollars to invest unlike you. Staking is great. If you don’t understand it then you don’t have enough capital to.,True,5,
Why would you stake?,"So you bought eth near the top and staking doesn’t make sense??? Staking is great for those who got in early or buy dips and plan to hold until it reaches 10k (a common sell aim).

Say you got 10 eth at 1500, and stake it at 3% for 4 years until it reaches 10k, that’s 1.25 eth or $12,250 at the sell price. That means you invested $15,000 which became 100,000 plus made $12,250 for holding it.

The question really is why would anyone that plans to hold longterm not stake. If you plan to swing trade then it doesn’t make as much sense but even swing trades with eth can take months to pull off well so it can be worth it.

Take home, stake some and trade some is likely the best route",True,5,
Why would you stake?,For long term holders. But yeah I'd rather keep the flexibility to sell on a whim as it's so volatile. The staking yield isn't worth it for me to miss selling opportunity that may not last long,True,2,

Why would you stake?,"Not selling, thats why.",True,1,
Why would you stake?,"Hey Jarvis, save this post and come back to it in 2030 please. Thank you",True,1,
Why would you stake?,I’ve been staking since the beginning my rewards are just about 4K. It’s actually more than a whole eth because like you said it’s volatile… and it still accumulates when the asset goes down. When the asset goes up again so does the value of the eth rewards I received. I’ve believed in the tech for almost a decade now. It’s paid me very well in rewards and gains. If you are a trader I wouldn’t stake but it was a no brainer for me and it’s paid off very well so far. Time in the market beats trying to time the market almost everytime unless you get lucky. Eth has proved it’s more valuable than dollars to me time and time again.Everytime I’ve sold eth I regretted it and the dollar will never gain value it’s like selling an appreciating asset for a deprecating asset. I’m not a day trader I work a blue collar job pretty decent 401k and a pension I’m vested in. I treat eth almost like a 3rd leg of my retirement portfolio and it’s paid off so far. Taking profits and paying more taxes is the last thing I’m trying to do. It’s also Way to much stress trying to time a volatile market.,True,1,
Why would you stake?,You can literally just short eth on perps for the same amount you would like to sell on spot. That way your short gains offset your spot losses.,True,1,
Why would you stake?,"Because staking is an essential part of Ethereum, not only can you become a validator with eno7gh staked and earn additional rewards but staking is built in to help manage liquidity. If no one staked and everyone was selling at ATH, price wouldve never broken a dollar...if people hold liquidity on sell side drops people have to pay more for buying value goes up, if youre targeting buying at 1400 like it was a few months ago and selling at 10k+ years from now, why wouldnt you stake and gain additional eth rather than holding for ages.
The reality is that over 85% of traders with your strategy lose money, because the dips are scary and you want to stay liquid, the question is why would you buy a volatile asset hoping to make a quick few hundred when you are just as quickly and lijely to lose a quick 300, over putting your money to work in a yield > any savings account and holding for the long term until you need that money with a vastly higher probability of profit",True,1,

Why would you stake?,Your whole premise is about timing the market. Which will burn you. Imagine you buy at 4300 and think it will go up to 4800 and then sell.

Any ways to get a small amount of free ETH?,"Now, im not a bottom feeder. But i have $20 worth of Fet (an eth based crypto I got awhile back) and want to sell it.

Now it says: Gas fee of  0.00003 ETH is needed.

Any way I can get this ETH without plugging in my card?",False,0,
Any ways to get a small amount of free ETH?,"no.

oh wait. 

  
1. **ETH Faucets**

These are websites that give out **very small amounts of ETH** (usually enough for gas) for free. Most require a crypto wallet address, sometimes a social media login. Examples:

* [faucet.metamask.io]() – Only works on Goerli or Sepolia testnets, not mainnet (good for testing, not spending).
* [Alchemy Goerli Faucet]() – Again, testnet ETH only.

⚠ **Important:** These give **testnet ETH**, not real ETH. If you want to move your FET to sell it, testnet ETH won’t work. Real ETH is needed for mainnet transactions.

# 2. Ask someone for a micro ETH transfer

If you have friends in crypto, sending **0.00003 ETH** is trivial. That’s about **$0.05 USD**—very cheap for someone to send.

# 3. Use a decentralized exchange that covers gas

Some DEXs (like certain bridges) allow you to sell tokens **without ETH**, but usually they:

* Swap your token for **another token that can pay gas** (rare for $20 FET).
* Or they have **“meta transactions”**, which pay the gas for you—but these are uncommon.

# 4. Convert FET via a centralized exchange

If you can send FET to **Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.**, you can sell it without worrying about tiny ETH for gas:

* On centralized exchanges, you don’t need ETH for gas.
* Then you can withdraw USD/AUD directly.

💡 **Bottom line:** For $20 of FET, the easiest option is to **send it to a centralized exchange and sell it there**.

BitMine Expands ETH Treasury to $6.6B Despite Stock Decline,"BitMine Immersion Technologies has boosted its Ethereum holdings, adding 373,000 ETH last week and bringing its total to 1.52 million tokens valued at $6.6 billion. This comes as institutional interest in Ethereum grows, although the company’s share price has dropped 14.2% since August 11, according to Google Finance.  
  
Chairman Thomas Lee said the company’s accumulation plan, known as the “alchemy of 5%,” is aimed at securing 5% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. A spokesperson added that Ethereum is being positioned as the backbone of modern financial systems and the token economy being shaped by AI. With exchanges like bitget recently giving European buyers more direct access to ETH cutting of 50% of the price, it’s not surprising that I’ve also been considering picking some up myself.  
  
With 1.3% of all Ether in circulation, BitMine is currently the largest corporate holder. SharpLink Gaming follows with 729,000 ETH worth $3.2 billion, while The Ether Machine holds 345,000 ETH worth about $1.5 billion.

What is the difference between Causevest Coin and Ethereum Coin Supply flows,"Eth does not have a fixed supply

• ETH is printed to reward validators for block generation or finality generation

• ETH is destroyed when people pay the basefee to get transactions into a block (EIP-1559 mechanism)

• This makes the ETH supply non-deterministic (it depends on the amount of stakers vs the demand for blockspace) The total supply can go up or down depending on these factors.

XCV has a predictable long term supply

• XCV has an initial total supply (the amount in all genesis UTXOs + seeded in all pools/pots at genesis)

• This value never changes numerically as the “total supply” or sum over all UTXO balances + pool balances is always the same as genesis.

• XCV also has a basefee system for transactions, but these coins flow into the Network Income Pool and are redistributed throughout the network. It never changes the total supply number",False,4,

Tom Lee, who serves as the Chairman of BitMine’s Board and is widely known from Fundstrat, said the team moved fast for a reason. “BitMine moved with lightning speed in its pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH..

Tom added that what makes BitMine stand out is how quickly it raised crypto NAV per share and how liquid the company’s stock has become.

Meanwhile, over the last five days, the average daily trading volume of BitMine’s stock has hit $1.6 billion, ranking the company 42nd among all 5,704 U.S.-listed stocks, just behind Uber Technologies, based on Fundstrat’s breakdown of Statista data.

If you could pay 2.5k monthly, isn't it better to DCA ETH/BTC/whatever? Some exchanges offer pretty good staking plans, so you could earm on your investments and catch even better prices. I believe that ETH will beat ATH this year, but if you didn't sell it at the right time, you will freeze your investments, probably for a few years.

Taking 35K USD loan for ETH,"People take that kind of loan to buy a depriciative asset like a car all the time, so it's not completely insane.

If you are in your early twenties with zero net worth and 35k is max you can loan, i would say hard pass. There will be many opportunities in life, both investment and experiences. Don't make it inaccessible due to debt.

countries, states, even the united States is making statements about bitcoin, for know for sure that bitcoin is the winning horse.

Taking 35K USD loan for ETH,This is the worst idea lmao,True,1,
Taking 35K USD loan for ETH,"Horrible idea. You are taking on debt with likely 10 to 15 percent APR, and even the lowest loan rates today are around 8 percent unless you are borrowing from family. That interest alone will eat into any gains. On top of that, if you sell your ETH later, taxes will crush you since all gains are taxable. You will be stuck with both the loan payments and a tax bill. Ethereum is not going to 8,400 dollars in a year, if it ever does. 

Realistically it may take 5 to 10 years, and by then the loan interest will have destroyed any upside if paying 2.5k a month. Totally not worth the risk.

Like 3x leverage
You have the option of up to 100x
Don’t fall for it you’ll just get liquidated 
3x could handle a price drop to like $1500 
If it gets ugly just get your hands on some more money and add to the collateral, thereby decreasing the leverage and lowering the liquidation price.

Taking 35K USD loan for ETH,"Honestly, I would say, get the loan in a smart way... NO FINANCIAL ADVICE HERE...I would say to loan/barrow against a hard asset, like your home or an investment home. Heck, build your portfolio to the threshold where the institution you bank with will allow you to barrow against your portfolio. I am only suggesting this because of the wild nature of the crypto asset class, and the time still needed for full institutional adoption (for you to barrow against your crypto portfolio). In the meantime I am thinking of doing the same... Leverage hard assets, have a payback amount that is covered by renters rent or that I can cover with a side hustle and count on the annual return of BTC & ETH to outpace the payback amount. Grant it, law of diminishing returns is a universal law, but the history shows that with a 6.6% note (with good credit), investing in ETH/BTC will outpace that day and night...

I'd say 10k is unlikely, but possible. I think 8k is more likely.

I was lucky to get in this year at a DCA of 1700. But I am planning to sell this year as well, as I believe a bear market will follow in the months after ATH's.

I'm going to be DCA'ing out. Meaning for example, I'll sell some at 7k, sell some at 8k, sell some at 9k, plan to sell the rest at 10k, but if it never hits 10k then I HODL the rest.

I've been watching and playing the crypto market since 2020, and it's just so risky man. It's mostly just psychology though. Most people see prices rising high, get excited or FOMO, and buy.

I know price & trading discussion isn’t allowed on r/ethereum so maybe price and trading discussion could be allowed on the r/eth sub and all trading/price discussion between the 2 subs could happen on r/eth?

"Eth just broke 4.4k, What to expect next","NFA 
Just personal observation for your inference 

5k in-bound 
——————
- 1T MC 10K per Eth by EOY is plausible 70/30 odds skew positive outlook 

👉Expect a slight pull back to 2.8-3k after major pump to 5k+ new ATH (1-2 months consolidation before peak euphoria) 

- ETH Treasury companies creating new financial products to back infrastructure and multi-leverage with RWA is a foreseeable future 

- Build on #ETH/@Polkadot/@solana -> bridge liquidity and infrastructure to BTC until miners exhaustion and sell pressure due to  not being able to hedge electricity cost (15-20 years black swan) 

‼️ 2008 like housing crisis risk in fruition = potential 50-70% retrace during crypto winter  

✅Long-term thesis stays the same 5-10 years steady above 1T MC is plausible = Multi-Angle incentives to keep the liquidity pool deep as a stable bridge to other chain of cheaper entry+easier interoperability e.g @Polkadot 

- This could very well be the last time ever we’ll see this price range before next crypto winter 2026 (3k-5k new floor)

Understanding about ETHT price (2x leveraged ETF on ETH price),"I'm not sure how to comprehend this fact, but back in Dec 6, 2024, the ProShares Ultra Ether ETF (ticker: ETHT) price was $170.10, while ETH future at the time was $4095 and ETH price was around $4005. Now, the ETH future was $4319 and ETH price was $4296.55 (at this moment), but the ETHT price was nowhere close to $170.10 ---> I wonder what the reason is?

Understanding about ETHT price (2x leveraged ETF on ETH price),"Leveraged ETFs don’t track the long-term price of the asset exactly. They’re designed to give 2× the daily move, not the total move over months.

For example, if I am an ETF that dropped from $100 to $90, it would be a 10% decrease. To go back to $100 from $90 I would need a 11% increase.

Now if that ETF was 2X leveraged, from $100 to $80 would be 20% decrease. From $80 to $100 would require a 25% increase.

"ETH Breaks $4,200 – How High Can It Go?","In this video, we analyze Ethereum’s breakout above $4,200, its historical resistance levels, and upcoming targets using multiple machine learning and risk-based models. We cover realistic and euphoria case scenarios, showing how ETH could range from $4,100 to $6,100 in a conservative case and potentially hit $8,600–$10,500 in an extreme bull run.

ETH Breakout: Is Altseason Officially Here?,"Looking at the recent performance of Ethereum (ETH), it's hard to ignore the significant upward trend! ETH is at $3,840.92 at the time of writing,  a remarkable 18.8% increase over the last year (1Y). More importantly, the current price is a strong breakout from what looked like a period of consolidation and even a dip around March-May.

This kind of strong upward movement in Ethereum is often a key indicator for the broader altcoin market. Historically, ETH has acted as a bellwether for ""Altseason"" – a period where many alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) experience substantial gains, often outperforming Bitcoin and even Ethereum itself.

**Why is ETH's breakout relevant to Altseason?**
 **Increased Confidence:** A strong ETH signals renewed investor confidence in the smart contract platform that underpins a vast majority of altcoins, including DeFi, NFTs, and various dApps.
 **Capital Rotation:** As ETH gains momentum, profits from ETH holdings often rotate into smaller-cap altcoins, fueling their price appreciation.
 **Ecosystem Health:** ETH's strength reflects the overall health and adoption of its ecosystem, which directly benefits projects built on Ethereum.

While past performance is not indicative of future results, this strong ETH breakout definitely has the crypto community buzzing about a potential Altseason. Keep an eye on your favorite altcoins – the tide might be turning!

Ten Years of Improving Ethereum: Key EIPs,"Here are the key Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that have significantly impacted Ethereum's development over its first decade:

* **EIP-20: Token Standard** (Adopted in 2017) : This EIP created the universal ERC-20 token standard, which streamlined token integration and catalyzed the ICO craze.
* **EIP-1559: Fee Markets** (Adopted in August 2021) : This proposal reformed Ethereum's fee market by introducing a dynamic ""base"" gas fee that is burned and an optional ""tip"" for validators, aiming to incentivize deflation and improve user experience.
* **EIP-3675: Proof-of-Stake** (also known as ""The Merge"") : This EIP replaced Ethereum's proof-of-work (PoW) with proof-of-stake (PoS), drastically reducing energy consumption and transforming ETH into a productive asset.
* **EIP-4844: L2 Blobs** (Implemented in March 2024) : This EIP introduced temporary storage space (""blobs"") for Layer 2 (L2) transaction data, significantly lowering L2 transaction costs and migrating much of Ethereum's activity to L2s.
* **EIP-3074: Wallet UX** (Merged in May 2025) : This proposal overhauled wallet functionality by giving externally owned accounts (EOAs) smart contract-like capabilities, enabling features like one-click approvals and gasless transactions to simplify the onchain experience.

These EIPs collectively shaped Ethereum into a constantly transforming ""living, breathing machine"" dedicated to providing decentralized compute.
